The rolling diaphragm technology perfected by ACE ensures complete separation of the damping fluid from the surrounding air. This makes it possible for direct installation in a pressure chamber to provide end stop damping in pneumatic cylinders up to approximately 100 psi (7 bar). <br/><br/>The rolling diaphragm delivers very low return forces for these maintenance-free, ready-to-install absorbers. An integrated positive stop and progressive energy capacities, with a wide range of effective weight, make these miniature shock absorbers a winner. Furthermore, the use of a side load adapter allows impact angles of up to 25°. Stainless steel options are available for greater environmental compatibility. Self-compensating shock absorbers react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment. <br/><br/>These self compensating miniature shock absorbers are capable of universal mounting even inside a cylinder. These shocks are ideal for use in multitude of applications including material handling equipment, packaging equipment, medium robotics and machine tools.</div></div><div class=\"pagerow__sidebar sidebar-offset\"> <a href=\"/us/calculations/shock-absorber-configurator.html?p=MC225M\" title=\"Configurator\" class=\"button button-link-secondary\"> Configurator </a> <span style=\"display: block; padding-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 13px;\"> Configure your individual shock absorber with the right accessories </span> <a href=\"/us/calculations/automation-control/online-calculation.html\" title=\"Calculation Tool\" class=\"button button-link\"> Calculation Tool </a> <span style=\"display: block; padding-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 13px;\"> Calculate the right shock absorber for your application </span><div class=\"image category-image\"><div class=\"lightbox--content\" id=\"lightbox--content\"><div class=\"lightbox--content--header\"><div class=\"segment\">Miniature Shock Absorbers</div><div class=\"hl1\">MC225M</div><div class=\"hl2\">Exceptionally high endurance and with the lowest resetting force</div><div class=\"hl3\">Self-Compensating, Rolling Diaphragm Technology<br/>Energy capacity 360 in-lbs/Cycle<br/>Stroke 0.50 in</div></div><div class=\"lightbox--content--image\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/media/msimages/resized/1200/ACE_MC150-MC600_FA_IMG_Single-01-cut-Labels_RGB-L_EN.jpg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. - Image - MC225M\"/></div><div class=\"lightbox--content--footer\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/skin/frontend/ace/default/images/ace-logo.svg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. © 2023\"/></div></div> <a href=\"#\" data-featherlight=\"#lightbox--content\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/media/msimages/resized/600/ACE_MC150-MC600_FA_IMG_Single-01-cut_RGB-L.jpg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. - Image - MC225M\"/> <span class=\"magnify\"/> </a></div></div></div>"

The rolling diaphragm technology perfected by ACE ensures complete separation of the damping fluid from the surrounding air. This makes it possible for direct installation in a pressure chamber to provide end stop damping in pneumatic cylinders up to approximately 100 psi (7 bar).\nThe rolling diaphragm delivers very low return forces for these maintenance-free, ready-to-install absorbers. An integrated positive stop and progressive energy capacities, with a wide range of effective weight, make these miniature shock absorbers a winner. Furthermore, the use of a side load adapter allows impact angles of up to 25°. Stainless steel options are available for greater environmental compatibility. Self-compensating shock absorbers react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment.\nThese self compensating miniature shock absorbers are capable of universal mounting even inside a cylinder. These shocks are ideal for use in multitude of applications including material handling equipment, packaging equipment, medium robotics and machine tools.\nConfigurator\nConfigure your individual shock absorber with the right accessories\nCalculation Tool\nCalculate the right shock absorber for your application\nMiniature Shock Absorbers\nMC225M\nExceptionally high endurance and with the lowest resetting force\nSelf-Compensating, Rolling Diaphragm Technology\nEnergy capacity 360 in-lbs/Cycle\nStroke 0.50 in"

The rolling diaphragm technology perfected by ACE ensures complete separation of the damping fluid from the surrounding air. This makes it possible for direct installation in a pressure chamber to provide end stop damping in pneumatic cylinders up to approximately 100 psi (7 bar). <br/><br/>The rolling diaphragm delivers very low return forces for these maintenance-free, ready-to-install absorbers. An integrated positive stop and progressive energy capacities, with a wide range of effective weight, make these miniature shock absorbers a winner.

The rolling diaphragm technology perfected by ACE ensures complete separation of the damping fluid from the surrounding air. This makes it possible for direct installation in a pressure chamber to provide end stop damping in pneumatic cylinders up to approximately 100 psi (7 bar).\nThe rolling diaphragm delivers very low return forces for these maintenance-free, ready-to-install absorbers. An integrated positive stop and progressive energy capacities, with a wide range of effective weight, make these miniature shock absorbers a winner. Furthermore, the use of a side load adapter allows impact angles of up to 25°. Stainless steel options are available for greater environmental compatibility. Self-compensating shock absorbers react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment.\nThese self compensating miniature shock absorbers are capable of universal mounting even inside a cylinder.

All models are characterized by high energy absorption and unite piston tube technology with the diaphragm seal perfected by ACE. This enables direct installation for end position damping in pneumatic cylinders at 72 to 102 psi (5 to 7 bar) or applications where deceleration needs to take place close to the pivot point. <br/><br/>They are maintenance-free, have an integrated positive stop and are mountable in any position.

All models are characterized by high energy absorption and unite piston tube technology with the diaphragm seal perfected by ACE. This enables direct installation for end position damping in pneumatic cylinders at 72 to 102 psi (5 to 7 bar) or applications where deceleration needs to take place close to the pivot point.\nThey are maintenance-free, have an integrated positive stop and are mountable in any position. The addition of a side load adapter allows for impact angles of up to 25°. These dampers offer soft contact deceleration where initial impact reaction forces are very low, with the advantages of self-compensation to react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment.\nThanks to their robust design and their durability, these miniature shock absorbers can be used for a wide range of applications.

Furthermore, the membrane accumulator serves as a compensation element for the oil displaced in the shock absorber and replaces the standard use of absorber materials.

These miniature shock absorbers manufactured from one solid piece are designed in such a way that they can be setup with a linear or a progressive braking curve. The soft damping character is thanks to the special, long strokes which produce smooth deceleration and low reaction forces. <br/><br/>These maintenance-free, ready-to-install hydraulic machine elements are equipped with an integrated positive stop. The use of side load adapter allows impact angles of up to 25°. Thanks to the designed overlapping effective weight ranges, these dampers cover an effective load range of 3 lbs. to 4,400 lbs! Self-compensating shock absorbers react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment.<br/><br/>These miniature self-compensating shock absorbers from the SC190 to SC925 product family are used in industrial, automation and machine engineering and primarily in the areas of handling and automation.</div></div><div class=\"pagerow__sidebar sidebar-offset\"> <a href=\"/us/calculations/shock-absorber-configurator.html?p=SC300M; 0 to 4\" title=\"Configurator\" class=\"button button-link-secondary\"> Configurator </a> <span style=\"display: block; padding-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 13px;\"> Configure your individual shock absorber with the right accessories </span> <a href=\"/us/calculations/automation-control/online-calculation.html\" title=\"Calculation Tool\" class=\"button button-link\"> Calculation Tool </a> <span style=\"display: block; padding-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 13px;\"> Calculate the right shock absorber for your application </span><div class=\"image category-image\"><div class=\"lightbox--content\" id=\"lightbox--content\"><div class=\"lightbox--content--header\"><div class=\"segment\">Miniature Shock Absorbers</div><div class=\"hl1\">SC300M; 0 to 4</div><div class=\"hl2\">Long stroke and soft impact</div><div class=\"hl3\">Self-Compensating, Soft-Contact<br/>Energy capacity 300 in-lbs/Cycle<br/>Stroke 0.75 in</div></div><div class=\"lightbox--content--image\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/media/msimages/resized/1200/ACE_SC190-SC925_FA_IMG_Single-01-cut-Labels_RGB-L_EN.jpg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. - Image - SC300M; 0 to 4\"/></div><div class=\"lightbox--content--footer\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/skin/frontend/ace/default/images/ace-logo.svg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. © 2023\"/></div></div> <a href=\"#\" data-featherlight=\"#lightbox--content\"> <img src=\"https://www.acecontrols.com/media/msimages/resized/600/ACE_SC190-SC925_FA_IMG_Single-01-cut_RGB-L.jpg\" alt=\"ACE Controls Inc. - Image - SC300M; 0 to 4\"/> <span class=\"magnify\"/> </a></div></div></div>"

These miniature shock absorbers manufactured from one solid piece are designed in such a way that they can be setup with a linear or a progressive braking curve. The soft damping character is thanks to the special, long strokes which produce smooth deceleration and low reaction forces.\nThese maintenance-free, ready-to-install hydraulic machine elements are equipped with an integrated positive stop. The use of side load adapter allows impact angles of up to 25°. Thanks to the designed overlapping effective weight ranges, these dampers cover an effective load range of 3 lbs. to 4,400 lbs! Self-compensating shock absorbers react to changing energy conditions, without adjustment.\nThese miniature self-compensating shock absorbers from the SC190 to SC925 product family are used in industrial, automation and machine engineering and primarily in the areas of handling and automation.\nConfigurator\nConfigure your individual shock absorber with the right accessories\nCalculation Tool\nCalculate the right shock absorber for your application\nMiniature Shock Absorbers\nSC300M; 0 to 4\nLong stroke and soft impact\nSelf-Compensating, Soft-Contact\nEnergy capacity 300 in-lbs/Cycle\nStroke 0.75 in"

The TR-L range has been specially developed for a maximum stroke with a minimum height and a range of 63.7 in-lbs to 95,411 in-lbs (7.2 Nm to 10,780 Nm). The absorption capacity is dependent on the length of the selected tube damper. These models are available in sizes between Ø 1.14““ and Ø 46.77““. (Ø 29 mm and Ø 188 mm).\nThe TUBUS TR-L is used where impact or collision protection is necessary along a straight line e.g. on shovels in mining equipment, loading and lifting devices, dock systems in shipbuilding or luggage and transport belts.\nProfile Dampers\nTR-L\nPowerhouse in long body length\nRadial Damping, Long Version\nEnergy capacity 63.7 in-lbs/Cycle to 68,151 in-lbs/Cycle\nMaximum stroke 0.67 in to 4.25 in"

They use special seals and fluids.
