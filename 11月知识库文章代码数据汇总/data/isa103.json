      "content": "May 20, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Members Schneider Electric, 1898 & Co., Dragos, and Idaho National Laboratory will serve as members of the international Operational Technology Cybersecurity Expert Panel appointed by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA).“Around the world, countries are planning their approaches to the persistent and significant cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure and industrial operations,” said ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Managing Director Andre Ristaino. “The US government is also painfully aware of the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, as highlighted by the recent attack on the Colonial Pipeline. This incident is only a wake-up call if you haven’t been paying attention. Our organizations have been advocating for smarter cybersecurity approaches for a decade or more through our standards committee, certification body, and most recently, the founding of the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance. Nearly 50 member companies, acting individually and as a group, are serving as subject matter experts in nearly every world region to drive adoption and usage of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards as the foundational basis for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk across all industry sectors.”Singapore’s approach to global concerns over cybersecurity includes a defined plan created by their government and the country’s Cyber Security Agency (CSA.) CSA launched itsOT Cybersecurity Masterplanin 2019, providing guidance to professionals working in OT environments with a focus on security industrial control systems. The three objectives of the masterplan are:To create awareness of the OT challenges faced across industries within SingaporeTo align the efforts of OT cybersecurity initiatives and to address cyber-threats, including a recommendation to leverage the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards within the Cybersecurity Code of Practice (CCOP) as one of the key components of a strong cybersecurity approachTo guide the development of effective cybersecurity initiatives, solutions, and to encourage partnerships with industry leaders and stakeholdersThe international Operational Technology Cybersecurity Expert Panel will discuss issues ranging from governance policies and processes, evolving operational technology technologies, emerging trends, capability development, supply chain, threat intelligence information sharing, and incident response. The panel will facilitate the sharing of information between the public and private sectors with a goal of strengthening local cybersecurity capabilities and competencies, protecting critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, water, and transport.The 11 panel members are:Marco (Marc) Ayala from the US, and is Director of Industrial Control System Cybersecurity (ICS) and sector lead at 1898 & Co, part of Burns & McDonnellChristophe Blassiau from France, an executive member of the WEF Cyber Resilience in Electricity and Oil and Gas Communities, and senior vice-president for cybersecurity and global chief information security officer at Schneider ElectricEric Byres from the US, chief executive officer of aDolus Technology, and senior partner at ICS Secure;Robert Hannigan from Britain, the chairman of BlueVoyant;Dr. Ong Chen Hui from Singapore, the cluster director for the BizTech Group at the Infocomm Media Development Authority;Joel Thomas Langill from the US, a managing member of the Industrial Control System Cyber Security Institute, and founder of Scadahacker;Robert Lee from the US, chief executive officer and co-founder of Dragos;Dale Peterson from the US, founder and chairman of S4 Events, and founder and chief executive officer of Digital Bond;Maggy Powell from the US, principal industry specialist at Amazon Web Services;Zachary Tudor from the US, associate laboratory director at the Idaho National Laboratory's National and Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate; andKazuo Yamaoka from Japan, senior solution architect at NTT Security Japan.Singapore's operational technology cybersecurity practitioners, operators, researchers and policymakers from the Government, critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors, academia, and other operational technology industries will have direct access to the experts, leveraging their knowledge to shape codes of practice, strategies for training Singapore’s workforce, the proliferation of compliance programs for devices, components, and systems, and more.In 2019, the ISA Security Compliance Institute announced an agreement with TÜV SÜD PSB, the German training, testing, and certification giant, to conduct certification assessments using ISASecure certification specifications in South East Asia. Simultaneously, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) and ISA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to provide certification body accreditations for the ISASecure® cybersecurity certification programs in the region, including the second certification body DNV GL whose Singapore office has also signed on as an ISASecure CB.Founded in 2007, the ISA Security Compliance Institute’s mission is to provide the highest level of assurance possible for the cybersecurity of automation control systems. ISCI has been conducting ISASecure® certifications on automation and control systems since 2011 through its network of ISO/IEC 17065 accredited certification bodies.

      "title": "ISA Provides Guidance to Newsweek Vantage Report on Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructure",
      "content": "March 26, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) recently served as the expert partner for an independent report from Newsweek Vantage on cyber risks to critical infrastructure.The report, titled “Weathering the Perfect Storm: Securing the Cyber-Physical Systems of Critical Infrastructure,” surveyed 415 executives at critical infrastructure organizations to learn whether they are taking a holistic approach to security for operations technology (OT) and information technology (IT). Among other takeaways, the survey found that a holistic approach is a priority for most—and that more than a third of respondents said a cyber breach was the motivating factor.ISA is the industry expert on standards for automation cybersecurity for OT systems. The ISA/IEC 62443 Series of Standards is the world’s only consensus-based series of standards on automation cybersecurity.“We’re proud to provide guidance as an expert partner with Newsweek Vantage on this independent report,” said Mary Ramsey, ISA executive director. “The security of critical infrastructure is complex by nature, and we believe research like this is an important part of understanding where the industry can improve as a whole.”Other key findings from the report include:IT and OT still don’t play well together at many organizations, despite years of effort. Nearly a third of respondents said the primary obstacle is cultural—in other words, that employees are resistant to change.Nearly every executive surveyed said their organization had experienced a security breach within the last year. Almost two-thirds said IT systems were the source of vulnerability leading to at least one of their incidents. A third also attributed their vulnerability to a lack of IT/OT integration, and a quarter added that a lack of secure physical access controls contributed to system vulnerabilities as well.Most organizations are at least partway along the path to IT/OT convergence. 68 percent of respondents said their organizations have integrated some of their OT, IT, and physical systems, and are still working on others. Far fewer—20 percent—have already integrated everything, and fewer still—only 11 percent—have not integrated anything.Eric Cosman, a consulting engineer and the 2020 ISA president, as well as Steve Mustard, an independent consultant and the incoming 2021 ISA president, also contributed to the report as subject-matter experts.“It was a privilege to represent ISA and the automation community in providing input to the Newsweek Vantage report,” Cosman said. “Vehicles such as this provide us with an opportunity to reach a much broader audience and raise the awareness of the risks faced by our critical infrastructure. Asset owners must take the time to fully understand the consequence component of this risk and plan their response accordingly using standards, practices, and other resources available to them.”“The Newsweek Vantage report is the end product of an important piece of research, of which I am very proud to have been a part,” Mustard says. “ISA has long understood the risks to critical infrastructure from cybersecurity incidents, and having the opportunity to be part of this work has allowed us to share our message much further. Although the report shows we still have a long way to go before industry fully embraces the challenge, it provides clear evidence of the need to do so.”Improving automation cybersecurity across all industries is a central part of ISA’s mission. It created the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (isa.org/ISAGCA) to advance cybersecurity readiness and awareness in manufacturing and critical infrastructure facilities and processes. It also offers a suite of automation cybersecurity training, includingcertificate programs.The full Newsweek Vantage report is available for downloadhere.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (www.isa.org) is a nonprofit professional association that sets the standard for those who apply engineering and technology to improve the management, safety, and cybersecurity of modern automation and control systems used across industry and critical infrastructure.

      "title": "ISA Position Paper States Importance of People to Automation",
      "content": "September 21, 2023Durham, N.C.Automation does not eliminate jobs, rather it repurposes existing jobs and creates new ones. Newposition paper offers recommendations on how policy makers and private-sector leaders can be best equipped to take advantage of the opportunity to deliver the many benefits of automation more effectively to their constituencies.DURHAM, N.C., 21 September 2023– TheInternational Society of Automation(ISA) – the leading professional society for automation – has announced the publication of a new position paper, “Automation Depends on People to Make the World a Better Place.”Automation is all around us, impacting everything from food we eat to clean drinking water to devices we use to reliably communicate to the safety of vehicles we travel in. Advances in manufacturing, technology, sustainability, and safety will all depend upon automation technologies and people working together to bring the most creative and innovative solutions to bear.But with each innovation in society, corresponding headlines and public concern are amplified that this new development will be responsible for job loss. This has been true of the printing press, the automobile, and the computer – and any newspaper you open today likely has a similar story about automation, robots, or artificial intelligence. In this paper, ISA explains its position that automation does not simply eliminate jobs as some believe, but rather repurposes existing jobs and creates new ones.“As a society, our focus should be on preparing our workforce to meet the high and growing demand for engineers and technicians,” said Claire Fallon, ISA Executive Director. “We must educate enough people to be well versed in automation technologies, as well as the industry standards and conformance programs that support the automation field.”Companies the world over are already citing the need for more qualified staff – a demand that will only continue to grow as technologies progress. There are many resources and training programs in place for automation professionals to advance their careers including those offered by ISA. These can and should be bolstered by additional focus within the K-12, vocational, and higher education communities to prioritize programs for the next generation of automation engineers and technicians.“Unfortunately, it’s a tale as old as time,” said Fallon. “US Congress held hearings in 1955 on ‘Automation and Technical Change,’ and one of the chief findings was that the ‘nation is faced with a threatened shortage of scientists, technicians, and skilled labor.’”Nearly 70 years later, ISA aims to bring the focus back to people, and back to the continued global need for more automation professionals to support our technology, safety, sustainability, and economic development goals.“ISA has a long history of preparing the automation profession with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful and effective,” said Steve Mustard, ISA Treasurer certified ISA trainer. “Keeping our finger on the pulse of technology advances and business challenges ensures that we are able to address upcoming demands and keep the profession evolving.”The position paper isavailable now on the ISA website.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

New </em><em>position paper offers recommendations on how policy makers and private-sector leaders can be best equipped to take advantage of the opportunity to deliver the many benefits of automation more effectively to their constituencies. </em><br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n<strong>DURHAM, N.C., 21 September 2023</strong>– The <a href=\"http://www.isa.org/\">International Society of Automation</a> (ISA) – the leading professional society for automation – has announced the publication of a new position paper, “<a href=\"https://www.isa.org/getmedia/959e50ff-0012-4899-8465-13728ae42239/Automation-Depends-on-People.pdf?utm_source=isa.org&utm_medium=isa.org&utm_campaign=Automation+Depends+on+People+Position+Paper\">Automation Depends on People to Make the World a Better Place</a>.”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nAutomation is all around us, impacting everything from food we eat to clean drinking water to devices we use to reliably communicate to the safety of vehicles we travel in. Advances in manufacturing, technology, sustainability, and safety will all depend upon automation technologies and people working together to bring the most creative and innovative solutions to bear.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nBut with each innovation in society, corresponding headlines and public concern are amplified that this new development will be responsible for job loss. This has been true of the printing press, the automobile, and the computer – and any newspaper you open today likely has a similar story about automation, robots, or artificial intelligence. In this paper, ISA explains its position that automation does not simply eliminate jobs as some believe, but rather repurposes existing jobs and creates new ones.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“As a society, our focus should be on preparing our workforce to meet the high and growing demand for engineers and technicians,” said Claire Fallon, ISA Executive Director. “We must educate enough people to be well versed in automation technologies, as well as the industry standards and conformance programs that support the automation field.”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nCompanies the world over are already citing the need for more qualified staff – a demand that will only continue to grow as technologies progress. There are many resources and training programs in place for automation professionals to advance their careers including those offered by ISA. These can and should be bolstered by additional focus within the K-12, vocational, and higher education communities to prioritize programs for the next generation of automation engineers and technicians.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“Unfortunately, it’s a tale as old as time,” said Fallon. “US Congress held hearings in 1955 on ‘<a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/84th%20Congress/Automation%20and%20Technological%20Change%20-%20Hearings%20%2875%29.pdf\">Automation and Technical Change</a>,’ and one of the chief findings was that the ‘nation is faced with a threatened shortage of scientists, technicians, and skilled labor.’”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nNearly 70 years later, ISA aims to bring the focus back to people, and back to the continued global need for more automation professionals to support our technology, safety, sustainability, and economic development goals.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“ISA has a long history of preparing the automation profession with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful and effective,” said Steve Mustard, ISA Treasurer certified ISA trainer. “Keeping our finger on the pulse of technology advances and business challenges ensures that we are able to address upcoming demands and keep the profession evolving.”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nThe position paper is <a href=\"https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-publications/position-white-papers\">available now on the ISA website</a>. <br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n<strong>About ISA</strong><br/>\r\nThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "May 24, 2022Durham, North CarolinaThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), global equipment suppliers, and other stakeholders announced the establishment of theElectric Energy OT Security Profileworking group hosted by theInternational Society of AutomationISA99 standards committee.TheElectric Energy OT Security Profilewill be a cybersecurity work product utilizing the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards. The final product will be a formal ISA/IEC 62443 application guide, recognized globally as the consensus work product for securing various control systems used in electric energy generation, transmission, and distribution operations.The ISA/IEC 62443 standards are designated as a horizontal standard, applicable to many industry sectors and applications. Industry groups leverage the ISA/IEC 62443 standard series as the basis for securing industrial control systems (ICS). DOE’s Securing Energy Infrastructure Executive Task Force (SEI ETF) evaluated available industry standards and recommended the electric energy OT applications be formalized as ISA/IEC 62443-5 security profile applications—gaining international energy sector consensus on applying ISA/IEC 62443 to electric energy OT applications.The ISAElectric Energy OT Security Profileworking group is seeking participation from industry groups, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Council on Large Electric Systems (CIGRE), and other industry stakeholders to ensure consideration of and alignment with other cybersecurity work product development efforts.The initiative will leverage the DOE SEI ETF’s Reference Architecture and Profiles for Electric Energy OT as a foundation for the ISA/IEC 62443-5 application profile development. The SEI Reference Architecture and Profiles and associated whitepaper will be available on the DOE website in the upcoming weeks.“The Securing Energy Infrastructure Executive Task Force developed an OT-specific reference architecture for electricity systems to provide a common language for control system environments that can be used to design and assess security applications,” Puesh Kumar, Director, DOE Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER). “The ISA Working Group represents an opportunity to validate these profiles and put them into practice for the energy industry. CESER is excited to see energy sector stakeholders carrying forward the task force’s reference architecture work.”TheElectric Energy OT Security Profilewill be publicly available at no charge for asset owners, manufacturers, standards organizations, and other industry stakeholders. The application profiles will be used as a basis for designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining electric energy OT systems and their cybersecurity capabilities. They will also be useful by third-party assessment organizations and regulatory authorities around the globe.Eric Cosman, Co-Chair of the ISA99 Standards Committee, noted that, “Global standards and supporting specifications provide efficiencies for end users, product suppliers, and system integrators that design, deliver, and support products and systems all around the world. One specification and one globally recognized certification provides needed transparency and reduces the regulatory burden on manufacturers.”Companies and individuals interested in participating in theElectric Energy OT Security Profileworking group should contact Eliana Brazda atebrazda@isa.orgto be added to the working group roster.About theInternational Society of AutomationThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

It gives us great pleasure to recognize their leadership efforts with ISA100 Wireless technology,” stated Andre Ristaino, managing director, ISAGCA, consortia, & conformity assessment.The Award-Winning ImplementationOMV Petrom chose ISA100 Wireless over other industrial IoT technologies and solutions because it met and exceeded OMV Petrom’s requirements for real-time oil field monitoring. ISA100 Wireless is the only Industrial IoT standards-based solution that can cover a large geographic area using a single IPv6 wireless mesh network.ISA100 Wireless certified field instruments were installed at eight oil wells spread over an area of 1.5 x 1.0 kilometers. Together with the wireless backbone infrastructure, they form a plant-wide wireless network. Information from oil field instrumentation is now available in real time throughout the site-wide network.The oil field data is being reported from the ISA100 Wireless network manager to a DCS via MODBUS TCP (ISA Level 3). Data is also being extracted and reported at ISA Level 4 via an OPC-UA interface to an OSI PI historian. The OPC-UA interface uses the OPC-UA approved ISA100 Wireless data model standardized by the WCI in cooperation with the OCP foundation. This is the world’s first wireless field deployment that utilizes OPC-UA data modeling based on the approved ISA100 Wireless information model.The real-time data is being used to pro-actively detect potential disruptions and avoid costly and disruptive oil well collapse. General oil well operations are also monitored in real time, allowing the crude to be extracted and transported in an efficient and cost-effective manner.Notable past end-user recipients of the ISA100 Wireless Excellence in Automation Award include EnQuest UK, Fuji Oil Company, Ltd., ILBOC, BAPCO, Alcoa, Phillips 66, PETRONAS, and Nippon Steele & Sumikin Engineering.Join us for our live webinar where we will discuss the project parameters, the challenges and solutions, and the realized benefits.

      "content": "September 07, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaNew York state legislature is hoping to add additional protections to the state’s critical infrastructure via anewly proposed cybersecurity bill. The bill leverages the industry-adopted ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards to shape metrics and benchmarks for operational technology cybersecurity. If passed, the bill’s measures would be applied to the state’s critical infrastructure facilities, including: public transportation; water and wastewater treatment facilities; public utilities and buildings; hospitals, public health facilities, financial service organizations; and automation and control system components.“There have been an increased amount of cyberattacks where hackers are just holding people hostage,”Senator Kevin Thomas, the bill’s sponsor, said. “The bill looks to address this by updating systems to match international standards so that the state’s critical infrastructure is protected as much as possible. There needs to be more vigilance. We need to know whether these critical infrastructure systems can be compromised and how to upgrade them to prevent them from being compromised.”The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, developed by the ISA99 committee and adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), provides a flexible framework to address and mitigate current and future security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems (IACSs). The committee draws on the input and knowledge of IACS security experts from across the globe to develop consensus standards that are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure.“The technologies that control and automate the world’s most critical operations, including the facilities where we work and live, are under constant threat and attack,” said ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Managing Director Andre Ristaino. “Consistent, global adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards will help vendors, third parties, and end users—indeed, the entire digital supply chain—effectively and proactively manage risks to their people, assets, and operations.”The ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA), made up of 50+ companies, continues to actively work to confront cybersecurity challenges in multiple ways. In general, a strong cybersecurity posture relies on people, process, and technology:People: Individuals and companies using automation and control systems must be well-trained, and companies must make better cybersecurity hygiene and best practices the fabric of their corporate and facility-level cultures.Process: The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, endorsed by the United Nations and backed by hundreds of asset owners in every world region, specifies how to assess and manage cybersecurity risk in OT environments. At the state and federal level, in the United States and around the world, the ISAGCA and its member companies are advocating policies that designate theuse of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards as foundational, outcome-focused, technology-neutral documentation. The series of standards articulates roles, responsibilities, and expectations of suppliers, service providers, and asset owners, which can be easily translated to enforceable policy elements.Technology: The ISA Security Compliance Institute offers conformance programs to certify components, devices, systems, and processes that are compliant with the latest ISA/IEC 62443 requirements. ISA advocates common-sense approaches to protecting legacy and next-gen equipment, leveraging the vast knowledge and expertise of our supplier and integrator member companies.Many critical infrastructure and industrial manufacturing companies already have orare working diligently to integrate cybersecurity into their risk-management and business continuity plans and strategies. Using the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards as their foundation, they focus on adopting security as part of the operations lifecycle, ensuring compliance with various aspects of the standards across their supply chains, and including cybersecurity in operational risk-management profiles.About ISAGCAThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) is a collaborative forum of member companies that aim to advance cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, andknowledge sharing industry-wide, on a global scale. The alliance’s objectives includeexpanding the development and use of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, knowledge-sharing in an open environment, providing best practice tools to help companies secure their infrastructure, creating education and certification programs, and advocating for cybersecurity awareness and sensible approaches with world governments and regulatory bodies.About ISAGCA MembersThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is made up of 50+ member companies, representing more than $1.5 trillion in aggregate revenue across more than 2,400 combined worldwide locations.

      "content": "May 11, 2022Durham, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation celebrated the first-ever International Automation Professionals Day on 28 April. The digital event engaged automation professionals from all around the globe to recognize their efforts in the vastly growing automation industry.ISA President Carlos Mandolesi said that automation professionals make up many diverse sectors, and having a day dedicated to those in the field can offer a learning opportunity for those unfamiliar with automation. “It is very common that our friends, relatives, and population in general do not understand what we do when we say that we work with automation,” he said. “It is important to have our own date to celebrate and promote the automation profession. ISA, as the home of automation, is the perfect organization to create it.”The focal point of the day was a call to action in which automation industry professionals and automation students were encouraged to submit photos of themselves working in the field, or testimonials about how they hope to have an impact in the world through automation.Mandolesi said that he was thrilled to see the positive feedback from all around the world. “The response was so amazing. I wanted to reply to all the social media posts to demonstrate how happy I was,” he said. “It was a huge success.”Several sections also had their own celebrations to correspond with the day, including the ISA Pune Section in India. Vishal Pansare, vice president of the digital manufacturing division at Logicon Technosolutions, said that his section held an event to recognize those in the field.“The ISA Pune Section celebrated this day by organizing a grand event where all members, automation professionals, and key leaders from large manufacturing companies located in Pune, like Tata Motors, Cipla, Thermax, and Coca-Cola, were invited,” he said. “The theme was how automation and digitization has been helping manufacturers in India, the latest trending technologies in manufacturing fields, and how they can be implemented by the factories.”Pansare also added that days like this are important for those in automation. “Days like International Automation Professionals Day are necessary to create awareness around the world about the field and how it contributes to our day to day lives.”Mandolesi is already looking forward to next year’s celebration and appreciates those who participated. “Thank you to all professionals, members, staff, and sections that invested time to create a post on social media or who organized large events to celebrate the day,” he said. “You are responsible for the success of our first International Automation Professionals Day.

It extends the previously published IoT Security Maturity Model (SMM): Practitioner’s Guide to provide mappings to existing 62443 standards and specific guidance for the asset owner, product supplier, and service provider roles,” said Ron Zahavi, Chief Strategist for IoT standards at Microsoft and IoT SMM co-author.The IIC IoT SMM helps organizations choose their security target state and determine their current security state. By repeatedly comparing the target and current states, organizations can identify where they can make further improvements.The ISA99 committee developed the 62443 series of standards, which the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted. The standards address current and future vulnerabilities in Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) and apply necessary mitigation systematically and defensibly. The ISA/IEC 62443 standards focus on maturity, but only on the maturity of security programs and processes.“Achieving security maturity targets can be difficult to put into practice without concrete guidance,” said Frederick Hirsch, co-chair of the IIC ISA/IIC Contributing Group. \"These 62443 mappings enable practitioners to better achieve security maturity by relating IIC IoT SMM practice comprehensiveness levels to ISA/IEC 62443 requirements. In this way, IACS asset owners and product suppliers can achieve appropriate maturity targets more easily.\"Eric Cosman, co-chair of the ISA99, said, \"While standards such as ISA/IEC 62443 are needed to codify proven and accepted engineering practices, they are seldom sufficient.

      "title": "ISAGCA and ICS4ICS Announce Cybersecurity First Responder Credentialing Program",
      "content": "July 13, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) and the Incident Command System for Industrial Control Systems (ICS4ICS) announced today the release of a cybersecurity first responder credentialing program.The ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance has joined forces with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and cybersecurity response teams from more than 50 participating companies to adopt FEMA's Incident Command System framework for response structure, roles, and interoperability. This is the system used by First Responders globally when responding to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, industrial accidents, and other high impact situations.Incident Command Systems have been tested over more than 30 years of emergency and non-emergency applications, throughout all levels of government and within the private sector.The ICS4ICS approach guides companies, organizations, and municipalities in identifying an incident, assessing damage, addressing immediate challenges, communicating with the right agencies and stakeholders, and resuming day to day operations. The framework applies traditional Incident Command Systems best practices to cybersecurity incidents, ensuring common terminology and enabling diverse incident management and support entities to work together. ICS4ICS provides clearly defined command structures, including standard roles needed in a response, and the framework can scale to support small or extremely large-scale incidents that impact many organizations.“For many years, we’ve needed ICS4ICS, to enable collectively organized cyber and physical responses in a unified way. Credentialing cybersecurity first responders is an important milestone in this valuable public-private partnership,” said ISAGCA Advisory Board chairperson and ICS4ICS leader Megan Samford, VP and Chief Product Security Officer of Schneider Electric’s energy management business. “We’ve developed an adjudication process and certified our first four responders. I’m proud to be one of them and stand ready to help companies recover from cyber incidents.”The adjudication process, managed by a formal committee within ICS4ICS, consists of an application process and panel of incident command system (ICS) subject matter experts who evaluate the candidate’s submittal. The inaugural round of credentialing recognizes these cybersecurity experts:Mark Bristow, Branch Chief of Cyber Defense Coordination at CISA, whose 15-year career with US government cybersecurity agencies includes responses to incidents ranging from Ukraine cyberattacks to attempts by Russian government hackers to intrude on energy equitiesNeal Gay, Senior Manager of Managed Defense/Industrial Control Systems at FireEyeMegan Samford, ISAGCA Chairperson; VP and Chief Product Security Officer of Schneider Electric’s energy management businessBrian Wisniewski, US Army ReserveInterested companies and organizations can engage with ICS4ICS to learn how they can participate in this multilateral preparedness scheme for responding to cyber incidents. There are no membership requirements to participate, and we are seeking broad engagement from both the private and public sectors. The proven approach is vetted by industry companies and subject matter experts and the program has significant value for small to medium sized entities that do not have the time, finances, or personnel to assign a full-time cyber response unit, but still need to develop plans and train employees accordingly.ISAGCA recently released a blog article on ICS4ICS entitled, “Addressing the Downstream Effect of a Cyber Attack,” as well as the webinar, “ICS4ICS Stands Up ICS Incident Response System 2021,” featuring Neal Gay.Interested parties can learn more atwww.isa.org/ICS4ICS.About ISAGCAThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is made up of 50 member companies, representing more than $300 billion in aggregate revenue across more than 2,400 combined worldwide locations.

      "title": "The International Electrotechnical Commission Designates ISA/IEC 62443 as a Horizontal Standard",
      "content": "November 17, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) are proud to announce that the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has officially designated the IEC/ISA 62443 series of standards as “horizontal,” meaning that they are proven to be applicable to a wide range of different industries.According to the IEC decision, “The IEC Technical Committee 65 (TC 65) publishes IEC 62443 for operational technology found in industrial and critical infrastructure, including but not restricted to power utilities, water management systems, healthcare, and transport systems. These horizontal standards, also known as base standards, are technology independent. They can be applied across many technical areas.”“The ISA99 committee of the International Society of Automation (ISA) and IEC Technical Committee 65 Working Group 10 have been collaborating on the development of the ISA/IEC 62443 cybersecurity standards for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) cybersecurity for many years. While broad applicability has always been the intent, there has been a common perception that they were most appropriate for process industries such as chemicals and refining,” explained ISA99 Co-Chair Eric Cosman. “Despite that perception, there have been several examples of successful applications in other sectors, such as transportation, building automation, metals and mining, and discrete manufacturing. It’s ultimately best for users if they can rely on one set of sector-agnostic standards, and we are very happy to receive the IEC decision to designate the ISA/IEC 62443 series as horizontal standards.”The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards is the world’s only consensus-based cybersecurity standard for automation and control system applications. These standards codify hundreds of years of operational technology and IoT cybersecurity subject matter expertise. Using the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards as a foundation, companies can focus on adopting security as part of the operations lifecycle, ensuring compliance with various aspects of the standards across their supply chains, and including cybersecurity in operational risk-management profiles.“While this news might seem like a procedural detail, it will have significant implications,” said Cosman. “Various other IEC technical committees that represent the needs and interests of specific sectors will presumably base their cybersecurity-related efforts on what is in the 62443 standards, focusing on defining how they should be interpreted and applied in a given set of circumstances. This will almost certainly lead to the creation of a set of sector-specific profiles for this purpose. To help in this effort, TC65 WG10 is developing guidance on how to develop such profiles, rather than pursue sector-specific and perhaps inconsistent standards. Guidelines, frameworks, training materials, and other resources can also take on a more general focus, incorporating the needs of many sectors.”The designation of the ISA/IEC 62443 series as a horizontal standard will have many benefits to stakeholders:Asset owners who have a presence in or exposure to more than one sector will be able to align their cybersecurity programs, leveraging ISA/IEC 62443 as the one single source for the fundamental principles and requirements of automation cybersecurityAutomation system suppliers will be able to certify their products for a broader range of applications, using a common set of conformance specifications based on 62443IEC TC 65 WG 10 and the ISA99 committee will be able to focus their efforts on collaboration and advancement of the series of standards, especially around current demands in areas such as IIoT, sensor-level security, and supply chain risksThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) and its 50+ member companies will partner with asset owners and suppliers to build relevant, applications-focused materials to enable companies in different sectors around the world to adopt and implement the series of standards at scale“The member companies of the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance have long believed in the broad applicability of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards,” said ISAGCA Chair Megan Samford. “We could not be more excited to see this news from IEC, because it echoes and confirms the work we’ve done. This series of standards is the only complete set of practices and security capabilities that can be applied to consistently assess and improve cybersecurity for operational technology systems, and our members stand ready to help companies all over the globe implement it successfully.”About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "February 13, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaFor the second year in a row, the International Society of Automation (ISA)-through its Water and Wastewater Industries Division (WWID)-is supporting an initiative designed to demonstrate the value of intelligent water systems, smart water technologies, and leveraging data for improved decision-making.The 2019 LIFT Intelligent Water Systems Challengeis a competition that encourages students, professionals, and technology enthusiasts to develop innovative solutions, particularly those using advanced sensing and/or data technology, that can be applied to water and wastewater collection, treatment, and distribution.The Challenge is a joint effort of The Water Research Foundation (WRF) and the Water Environment Federation (WEF). Serving as supporting organizations are: ISA, the American Water Works Association (AWWA), the Cleveland Water Alliance, the Water Council, the WaterTap Technology Acceleration Project, and the Smart Water Networks Forum (SWAN).\"We're pleased to again welcome ISA, a technical association that works to advance the use of automation and technology in the water and wastewater treatment industry, as a supporting organization of the LIFT Intelligent Water Systems Challenge,\" states Lisa McFadden, Director of Integrated Technical Programs and the Associate Director of the Water Science & Engineering Center at WEF. \"Last year's Challenge prompted a lot of interest and ideas around intelligent water systems and we're expecting great things this year as well.\"The Challenge kicked off earlier this month and will run through 23 September 2019. Teams will have until 22 April 2019 to submit a Challenge Plan and until 2 August 2019 to submit a Challenge Solution. Judges will award a top prize of $10,000. Recognition will also be given to innovative approaches and to outstanding contributions from students or young professionals. Get more details by visiting theChallenge website.\"ISA's Water and Wastewater Industries Division is pleased to be a supporter of the 2019 LIFT Intelligent Water Systems Challenge, as it is a flagship program that brings out the best of what people and automation technology can do in the municipal water/water sector,\" emphasizes Graham Nasby, a long-time leader within ISA's WWID and a widely recognized expert within the water/wastewater community. \"ISA is committed to helping professionals in the water and wastewater industries improve safety, efficiency, and operational performance through automated controls, instrumentation, and other advanced technologies.\"Nasby says that for well over a decade ISA's WWID has collaborated with WEF and other professional associations to conduct an annual symposium to showcase the value of automatic control applications, sensors and instrumentation, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), and engineering best practices to the treatment and distribution of water, and the collection and treatment of wastewater.In 2019, ISA as part of its goals to serve the needs of municipal water/wastewater community, will be rolling out an all-new event, the ISA Energy and Water Automation Conference, which will be held 7-8 August 2019 at the Omni Championsgate Resort in Orlando, Florida, USA. The conference will combine ISA's popular power and municipal water programs into a single, two-day gathering with additional content on industrial water applications. Topics of emphasis include data analytics, IIOT, Smart Cities Initiative, and cybersecurity.\"ISA has a strong history of supporting the needs of automation professionals in a wide variety of industries, including the municipal water/wastewater sector,\" Nasby says. \"With its new ISA Energy and Water Automation Conference in 2019, ISA hopes to further advance its goals of creating a better world through automation, by encouraging the sharing of information and ideas between the electric power and water/wastewater sectors.

      "content": "August 28, 2023Durham, N.C.New position paper offers recommendations on how policy makers and private-sector leaders can be best equipped to address the urgent need for improved critical infrastructure cybersecurity.TheInternational Society of Automation(ISA) – the leading professional society for automation – has announced the publication of a new position paper, “Advancing Industrial Cybersecurity.”Cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities pose a clear and present danger to our facilities, our processes, and the safety of our communities. As the position paper describes, when most people think about cybersecurity, they focus on what are commonly considered information technology (IT) challenges impacting individual equipment or networks. While these are valid concerns, the impact on the facility or its operation from equipment or network compromise is much more concerning.This position paper aims to address how policy makers and private-sector leaders can be best equipped to address the urgent need for improved critical infrastructure cybersecurity through globally relevant standards and conformance programs, as well as strong support for the community of engineers and automation professionals working every day to keep our facilities, processes, and communities safe.Asset owners and policy makers the world over are making key decisions about how to protect critical infrastructure environment. These stakeholders should rely upon a broadly used set of consensus standards to address the security of industrial automation and control systems –ISA/IEC 62443– as well asISASecureconformity assessment programs to demonstrate compliance with these standards.“In addition to raising awareness about the existing standardization solutions to support critical infrastructure, our position paper calls for greater awareness, education and training to equip engineers for the unique and growing challenges of the industrial cybersecurity environment,” said Steve Mustard, ISA Treasurer and industrial cybersecurity subject matter expert. “Training is just one need among many. In reality, what a lot of organizations require is a cultural shift that prioritizes cybersecurity alongside functionality, efficiency, and safety as one of the fundamental workplace tenets.”The position paper isavailable now on the ISA website. Future position papers to be published by the Society will address such topics as the role of automation in workforce development and job creation.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "January 08, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has confirmed it will integrate the widely used ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards into its forthcoming Common Regulatory Framework on Cybersecurity (CRF). The CRF will serve as an official UN policy position statement for Europe.At its recent annual meeting in Geneva, UNECE's Working Party on Regulatory Cooperation and Standardization Policies recognized the ISA99 standards development committee for its leading role in conceiving and developing the widely used standards, while formally accepting review input presented on behalf of ISA99 by committee member Pierre Kobes of Siemens.The ISA/IEC 62443 standards are developed primarily by the ISA99 committee of the International Society of Automation (ISA), with simultaneous review and adoption by the Geneva-based International Electrotechnical Commission. ISA99 draws on the input of cybersecurity experts across the globe in developing consensus standards that are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure, providing a flexible and comprehensive framework to address and mitigate current and future security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems.\"The Common Regulatory Framework will serve to establish a common legislative basis for cybersecurity practices within the massive EU trade markets,\" points out Glenn Merrell of Industrial Control System Security. \"This formal recognition is greatly valued and appreciated as another important validation of the industry-leading work of the experts on ISA99 who have contributed their knowledge and time in developing the ISA/IEC 62443 series,\" adds Merrell, an ISA Certified Automation Professional®(CAP®) who was instrumental in representing ISA99 to UNECE.\"This recognition reflects the growing and widespread adoption of ISA/IEC 62443 by government organizations and manufacturing sectors throughout the world,\" emphasizes ISA Executive Director Mary Ramsey. \"Beyond our role as a global standards developer, ISA is fully cognizant of and has prioritized our responsibility as an international nonprofit association of automation professionals to support and advance the understanding and application of these critical standards through our supplier-neutral cybersecurity education and training programs, developed with guidance from leading ISA99 experts.\"For more information on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, contact Charley Robinson, ISA Standards,crobinson@isa.orgor 1-919-990-9213.

This award was presented to EnQuest UK for leadership and creativity in the design and implementation of ISA100 Wireless Applications for Safe Gas Detection.Join us on August 17th, 2022, at 11 AM ET for a live webinar where we will be presenting this exciting case study, “A new approach to gas detection - Achieving a safe and secure system upgrade on a vast scale.” Registerhere.Draeger have designed and implemented, in collaboration with EnQuest UK, the largest ISA100 Wireless gas detection system in the UK, one of the largest in the world, at the EnQuest UK-operated Sullom Voe Terminal. The system includes 122 Wireless gas detectors and employs dual redundancy, retaining complete safe gas detection coverage following any component failure.The ISA100 Wireless system represents an estimated 70-80% cost saving, confirmed by the customer, compared with a hard-wired gas detection system due to removal of the cost of extensive civil ground works and above ground cable containment at a site covering 640 acres/2.6sq/kms. This is the first UK site where Wireless gas detection is the dominant technology, present on an original late 1970’s processing plant, covering a large geographical area with limited field cabling availability. It represents a huge leap forward in terms of maintaining high safety standards with reduced costs. Wireless gas detection solves a problem SVT had been wrestling with, justifying a large capex spend project on an ageing limited life asset. The system was interfaced direct to the site’s distributed control system (DCS) for operator and emergency response alarm interface.About the ISA100 Wireless Compliance InstituteISA100 Wireless Compliance Institute (WCI) is a non-profit industrial consortium under the umbrella of the International Society of Automation (ISA) with the following focus: ISA100 Wireless market penetration activities, awareness information dissemination, technical support, conformance testing services to ensure interoperability.

      "title": "New ISA/IEC Standard Provides Auditable Approach to Assessing Cybersecurity Risk",
      "content": "September 15, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe new standard can be applied across all industry and critical infrastructure sectors that depend on secure IACS operations.The widely used ISA/IEC 62443 Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) Security standards, developed primarily by the ISA99 standards development committee with simultaneous review and adoption by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), provide a flexible framework to address and mitigate current and future IACS security vulnerabilities. The ISA99 committee draws on the input and knowledge of IACS security experts from across the globe to develop consensus standards that are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure.A vital new standard in the series is based on the understanding that each organization that owns and operates an IACS has its own tolerance for risk—and that each IACS represents a unique risk depending on the threats it is exposed to, the likelihood of those threats arising, the inherent vulnerabilities in the system, and the consequences if the system were to be compromised. The new standard, ISA/IEC 62443-3-2:Security Risk Assessment for System Design, defines a comprehensive set of engineering measures to guide organizations through the essential process of assessing the risk of a particular IACS and identifying and applying security countermeasures to reduce that risk to tolerable levels.The new standard can be effectively applied across all industry and critical infrastructure sectors that depend on secure IACS operations. Moreover, it provides much-needed guidance to all key stakeholder categories, including asset owners, system integrators, product suppliers, service providers, and compliance authorities.“Currently, there is wide degree of variability in how industry defines and conducts IACS risk assessments,” says John Cusimano of aeSolutions, who led the ISA99 subgroup that wrote the standard. “ISA/IEC 62443-3-2 establishes fundamental requirements for an IACS risk assessment without being overly prescriptive. The result is a standard that will bring uniformity across industry while still allowing IACS owners and operators to apply any methodology that is compliant with the standard.”The new standard is the latest in a string of notable milestones in the ongoing development and growing global application of the ISA/IEC 62443 series. This included a decision by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to integrate the widely used standards into its Common Regulatory Framework on Cybersecurity, which serves as an official UN policy position statement for Europe. It also included completion of several key additional standards, including:ISA/IEC 62443-4-1,Product Security Development Life-Cycle Requirements, which specifies process requirements for the secure development of products used in an IACS and defines a secure development lifecycle for developing and maintaining secure products.ISA/IEC 62443-4-2,Technical Security Requirements for IACS Components, which provides the cybersecurity technical requirements for components that make up an IACS, specifically the embedded devices, network components, host components and software applications.Other standards in the ISA/IEC 62443 series cover terminology, concepts, and models; establishing an IACS security program; patch management; and system security requirements and security levels.

      "content": "October 28, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaKeeping pace with significant advances in motor speed control technologies, the International Society of Automation (ISA) has published a second edition ofMotors & Drives: A Practical Technology Guide.This new release has been updated to reflect innovative new motor and drive technologies that are safer, smarter, and easier to program and implement; provide superior diagnostic capabilities; and deliver seamless integration.\"The second edition will continue to serve as a straight-forward guide for those seeking to understand the key engineering principles of motors and drives,\" says author Dave Polka, a widely recognized expert in developing training and technical support materials for major drive manufacturers. \"However, while basic theory of AC and DC drives haven't changed, technology certainly has. The book takes a fresh look at how market demands have advanced motor and drive technology and are pushing the industry in new directions.\"As a result, Polka says he has incorporated a substantial amount of new and updated content to highlight recent technological developments, explain complex technical concepts and define buzz words-such as \"harmonics\" and \"power quality\"-in practical, easy-to-understand terms.While demystifying drive and motor technology used in today's modern manufacturing processes, the book is rooted in the practical side of drive and motor use, with the \"design engineering\" side of technology presented in commonly used terms. Included are clearly stated summaries, and highly relevant review questions, glossaries, and reference tables for formulas and conversions.The book is suited to a broad range of professionals, particularly engineers who are unfamiliar with motor and drive technology and technicians who are technically literate but not accustomed to complex theory and mathematics.

      "content": "February 26, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaBy describing the implementation and use of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) through an operations-focused approach, a new ISA book aims to help manufacturing engineers improve plant floor efficiency, quality, and productivity.Manufacturing Execution Systems: An Operations Management Approachby Grant Vokey and Thomas Seubert—two widely recognized, experienced experts in manufacturing operations and processes—explains that because MES are most commonly and inadequately defined through an IT-based, rather than a business operations perspective, their potential to improve manufacturing results has been significantly limited.“While other books on MES provide a very IT-centric view of MES (database structure, programming, server structure, etc.), our book explains MES from an operations and continuous improvement context and how to tie MES into other corporate planning and improvement initiatives,” says Vokey. “Most IT consultants don’t have the operations knowledge to properly define, explain or configure an MES.”Vokey explains that MES should be regarded as an application used in the overarching discipline of Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM), a more holistic approach to manufacturing floor operations that includes production management, facilities management (related to production equipment), process improvement and initiatives such as Lean, Six Sigma, and others.“Operations management is all about cost savings and maximizing profitability,” Vokey points out. “Taking an operations management approach to MES provides stability in process (preventing human error) and removes the ‘noise’ of uncontrolled variation in process that hides problems and prevents continuous improvement. MES also support continuous improvement in almost every department of operations by making the same data available to be interpreted by different departments in operations.”“Our book clears up a lot of misunderstandings about MES and how it fits in with both enterprise resource planning and product lifecycle management to deliver on the concept of MOM,” Seubert says. “MES has been incorrectly considered as just a ‘system’ and not a set of at times interdependent business processes. This is why some people mistakenly think that the industrial internet of things (IIoT) can replace MES: IIoT is the new technology that enables MES.”To help manufacturing professionals capitalize on the potential of MES to drive real-time, data-driven performance improvement, the book explains:MES application in regard to operations planning, analysis, and reportingThe full scope of an MES implementation and planning and its impact on manufacturing operationsIT concepts related to MES and how they apply to manufacturing operationsHow MES can be applied to IIoTThe book is suited to a broad range of manufacturing-focused professionals, particularly manufacturing and quality engineers (as well as students of these areas), Lean and Six Sigma consultants, operations managers (as well as students of operations management) and senior managers of manufacturing companies that are looking into MES.

However, until now, there has been limited ability to respond as a unified whole to these worldwide threats. But by establishing an open, collaborative, and transparent body, with a focus on strengthening people, processes, and technology, we can drive true cultural change. We are pleased that ISA has stepped forward, and we look forward to working openly and collaboratively with them, our fellow Founding Members, and many others affiliated with global industry, especially end users. Together we will bring to bear the standards-based technology, expertise, and special skills required to better secure and protect the world's most critical operations and the people and communities we serve.\" ---Klaus Jaeckle, Chief Product Security Officer, Schneider Electric\"Cybersecurity is critical to digital transformation. It's critical not only for the protection of information and intellectual property, but also for the protection of physical assets, the environment, and worker safety. We make it a priority to collaborate with partners and research institutions to develop secure products. Rockwell Automation participated in the development of the 62443 standards from the beginning and continues to support ISA cybersecurity initiatives. Our engagement with the Global Cybersecurity Alliance will be another important step in our efforts to help customers identify and mitigate risks.\" ---Blake Moret, CEO, Rockwell Automation\"At Honeywell, we see cybersecurity as a core part of the future we are making, and we see the Global Cybersecurity Alliance as an important way to work together to make that happen. Cybersecurity is critical to the connected world we live in and the cornerstone of trust that the world needs to be able to operate. Whether protecting critical infrastructure or managing a building's operations, users need to do this with the confidence that the employed systems are robust and secure. We are committed to and proud to work together with ISA and the GCA members to continue to drive the adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and identify further ways to secure and protect the connected world. Honeywell has a robust history with ISA and is also founding member of the ISA Security Compliance Institute.\"---Matthew Bohne, Vice President and Chief of Product Security, Honeywell Building Technologies\"Digital transformation in the building sector continues to accelerate, which heightens the urgency for cybersecurity across the industry and beyond. As a leader in the industrial automation controls business, Johnson Controls is already a strategic member of the ISASecure program and is consistently taking proactive actions to protect customers against cyber-threats and risks. Joining ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is a necessary and meaningful step as it supports our company values, customer adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 standard and efforts to educate global government and regulatory bodies. We are proud to solidify our commitment to this important effort.\" ---Jason Christman, Vice President, Chief Product Security Officer, Global Products, Johnson Controls\"One of the most effective ways to drive consistency in an industry is by putting standards in place, and we're looking forward to collaborating with all of these founding members, as well as future Alliance members, to help drive global best-practices forward in this historically standard-less environment. Claroty is committed to the mission of protecting all IoT and OT networks from cyber risks. Through our work with the Global Cybersecurity Alliance, we will be able to help shape the future of cybersecurity in these high-risk industries.\" ---Dave Weinstein, Chief Security Officer, Claroty\"Nozomi Networks believes real community collaboration, actionable standards and effective education are key ensuring a secure future for industrial organizations around the world. That's why we are helping develop secure-by-design standards as a working member of ISA99 standards committees, why we've designed our industrial cyber security solutions for easy integration across the broadest possible set of industrial and IT technologies; and why we are thrilled to help establish the Global Cybersecurity Alliance. Together we will build a secure future for the industrial infrastructure that runs the world.\" ---Andrea Carcano, Nozomi Networks Co-founder and Chief Product OfficerFacebookTwitterLinked In",

However, until now, there has been limited ability to respond as a unified whole to these worldwide threats. But by establishing an open, collaborative, and transparent body, with a focus on strengthening people, processes, and technology, we can drive true cultural change. We are pleased that ISA has stepped forward, and we look forward to working openly and collaboratively with them, our fellow Founding Members, and many others affiliated with global industry, especially end users. Together we will bring to bear the standards-based technology, expertise, and special skills required to better secure and protect the world's most critical operations and the people and communities we serve.\" --- <strong><em>Klaus Jaeckle, Chief Product Security Officer, Schneider Electric</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Cybersecurity is critical to digital transformation. It's critical not only for the protection of information and intellectual property, but also for the protection of physical assets, the environment, and worker safety. We make it a priority to collaborate with partners and research institutions to develop secure products. Rockwell Automation participated in the development of the 62443 standards from the beginning and continues to support ISA cybersecurity initiatives. Our engagement with the Global Cybersecurity Alliance will be another important step in our efforts to help customers identify and mitigate risks.\" --- <strong><em>Blake Moret, CEO, Rockwell Automation</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"At Honeywell, we see cybersecurity as a core part of the future we are making, and we see the Global Cybersecurity Alliance as an important way to work together to make that happen. Cybersecurity is critical to the connected world we live in and the cornerstone of trust that the world needs to be able to operate. Whether protecting critical infrastructure or managing a building's operations, users need to do this with the confidence that the employed systems are robust and secure. We are committed to and proud to work together with ISA and the GCA members to continue to drive the adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and identify further ways to secure and protect the connected world. Honeywell has a robust history with ISA and is also founding member of the ISA Security Compliance Institute.\"<em> </em> --- <strong><em>Matthew Bohne, Vice President and Chief of Product Security, Honeywell Building Technologies</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Digital transformation in the building sector continues to accelerate, which heightens the urgency for cybersecurity across the industry and beyond. As a leader in the industrial automation controls business, Johnson Controls is already a strategic member of the ISASecure program and is consistently taking proactive actions to protect customers against cyber-threats and risks. Joining ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is a necessary and meaningful step as it supports our company values, customer adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 standard and efforts to educate global government and regulatory bodies. We are proud to solidify our commitment to this important effort.\" --- <strong><em>Jason Christman, Vice President, Chief Product Security Officer, Global Products, Johnson Controls</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"One of the most effective ways to drive consistency in an industry is by putting standards in place, and we're looking forward to collaborating with all of these founding members, as well as future Alliance members, to help drive global best-practices forward in this historically standard-less environment. Claroty is committed to the mission of protecting all IoT and OT networks from cyber risks. Through our work with the Global Cybersecurity Alliance, we will be able to help shape the future of cybersecurity in these high-risk industries.\" --- <strong><em>Dave Weinstein, Chief Security Officer, Claroty</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Nozomi Networks believes real community collaboration, actionable standards and effective education are key ensuring a secure future for industrial organizations around the world. That's why we are helping develop secure-by-design standards as a working member of ISA99 standards committees, why we've designed our industrial cyber security solutions for easy integration across the broadest possible set of industrial and IT technologies; and why we are thrilled to help establish the Global Cybersecurity Alliance. Together we will build a secure future for the industrial infrastructure that runs the world.\" --- <strong><em>Andrea Carcano, Nozomi Networks Co-founder and Chief Product Officer</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n                                <ul class=\"socialBar\">\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-facebook\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/InternationalSocietyOfAutomation\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Facebook</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-twitter\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ISA_Interchange\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Twitter</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-linkedin\" target=\"blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=137598\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Linked In</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\r\n                    </article>\r\n                    ",

      "title": "ISAGCA Releases Position Paper on Automation Cybersecurity Requirements in Public Policy",
      "content": "August 10, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) announced the release of a position paper detailing the automation cybersecurity public policy views of the organization and its 50 industry-leading companies.Recent discussions have surfaced in the United States and other world governments about how to best secure automation and control systems that affect our everyday lives, especially in critical infrastructure. US President Biden issuedExecutive Order 14028on 12 May 2021, addressing securing automation in critical infrastructure; and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliancesubmitted a formal response.ISAGCA and its member companies hope the executive order and other measures will encourage those who support the nation’s critical infrastructure to develop and implement automation cybersecurity capabilities to protect and secure technologies that impact our daily lives.ISAGCA member companies and thought leaders have a long history of adopting a standards-based approach for securing automation products and operating sites based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of international cybersecurity standards. The ISA/IEC 62443 standards and technical reports have been successfully applied to a wide variety of industry sectors, including process industries such as chemicals and oil & gas, building automation, electric power generation and distribution, medical devices, and transportation.“It is critically important for legislators and regulators to recognize the urgent need for a unified response to this threat,” said ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Managing Director Andre Ristaino. “Standard definitions and a common language for asset owners, product suppliers, and all other control system stakeholders is necessary to simplify procurement and enable companies to comply with any regulatory efforts. A fully developed ISA/IEC 62443 ecosystem enables facilities and operations across many different industries to achieve industrial control systems and automation cybersecurity.”ISAGCA continues to work with state and federal legislators, regulators, and other standards bodies to ensure that the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are included as the reference standards for establishing IACS cybersecurity metrics in automation that affects our everyday lives. This position paper describes the public policies and associated reference standards supported by ISAGCA.You can download the position paperhere.About ISAGCAThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) is a collaborative forum of member companies that aim to advance cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, and knowledge sharing industry-wide, on a global scale.

US President Biden issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Order 14028</a> on 12 May 2021, addressing securing automation in critical infrastructure; and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance <a href=\"https://gca.isa.org/blog/isagca-submits-comments-to-nist-in-response-to-eo-14028\" target=\"_blank\">submitted a formal response</a>.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nISAGCA and its member companies hope the executive order and other measures will encourage those who support the nation’s critical infrastructure to develop and implement automation cybersecurity capabilities to protect and secure technologies that impact our daily lives.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nISAGCA member companies and thought leaders have a long history of adopting a standards-based approach for securing automation products and operating sites based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of international cybersecurity standards. The ISA/IEC 62443 standards and technical reports have been successfully applied to a wide variety of industry sectors, including process industries such as chemicals and oil & gas, building automation, electric power generation and distribution, medical devices, and transportation.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n“It is critically important for legislators and regulators to recognize the urgent need for a unified response to this threat,” said ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Managing Director Andre Ristaino. “Standard definitions and a common language for asset owners, product suppliers, and all other control system stakeholders is necessary to simplify procurement and enable companies to comply with any regulatory efforts. A fully developed ISA/IEC 62443 ecosystem enables facilities and operations across many different industries to achieve industrial control systems and automation cybersecurity.”<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nISAGCA continues to work with state and federal legislators, regulators, and other standards bodies to ensure that the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are included as the reference standards for establishing IACS cybersecurity metrics in automation that affects our everyday lives. This position paper describes the public policies and associated reference standards supported by ISAGCA.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can download the position paper <a href=\"https://gca.isa.org/isagca-public-policy-position-paper\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>About ISAGCA</strong><br/>\r\nThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) is a collaborative forum of member companies that aim to advance cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, and knowledge sharing industry-wide, on a global scale.

      "title": "ISA Survey: Standards 'Extremely Important' in the Future",
      "content": "July 20, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaMost respondents to a survey of automation engineering professionals conducted by ISA believe that standards will play a big role in the industry’s future.The International Society of Automation (ISA) recently surveyed 290 people in the automation engineering field to discover their thoughts on industry standards. The survey shows that 63 percent of respondents believe that standards will be “extremely important” in the future.Conducted in June 2020, the online survey received 290 responses from automation engineering professionals, primarily from the United States, Europe, and Canada. 42 percent of respondents described themselves as engineers, 21 percent as consultants, 15 percent as managers, and 8 percent as executives. The remaining 14 percent reported as a mix of technicians, operators, salespeople, marketers, or other roles. Survey respondents most commonly worked at system integrators (35 percent), asset owners (30 percent), or automation providers (22 percent).Most survey respondents (77 percent) said they are ISA members. 41 percent of respondents said they have more than 30 years of experience in their field; 26 percent said they have 20 to 30 years of experience; 21 percent said they have 10 to 20 years; 12 percent said they have 0 to 10 years.Key findings include:An overwhelming majority of survey respondents believe that, in the future, standards will be “extremely important” (63 percent) or “important” (33 percent)Most respondents (87 percent) believe that industry standards make processes and facilities saferMost respondents (81 percent) believe that industry standards help companies prove compliance to regulationsMost respondents (67 percent) believe that industry standards make it easier to train and cross-train people in technical jobsMost respondents (63 percent) believe that industry standards make processes and facilities more cyber-secureThe survey also asked questions specific to ISA standards. Survey takers were asked whether they agreed, disagreed, or had a neutral stance on statements regarding characteristics of ISA standards.89 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “ISA’s standards are relevant and valuable to multiple industries;” 9 percent were neutral and 1 percent disagreed85 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “It’s important for ISA standards to be harmonized and accepted by a global body;” 10 percent were neutral and 4 percent disagreed76 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “ISA’s standards are unbiased and do not favor any single supplier;” 20 percent were neutral and 3 percent disagreed72 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “The importance of standards in general is well-known and understood within my company;” 21 percent were neutral and 7 percent disagreed68 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “ISA’s standards development process is open and transparent;” 29 percent were neutral and 3 percent disagreedThe findings of the ISA survey confirm that automation engineering professionals rely on industry standards. Survey respondents suggested that standards are essential to maintaining excellence in their work. In general, respondents have a positive outlook about standards, and they believe that standards will continue to be just as critical, if not more so, in the future.“In creating this survey, ISA wanted to demonstrate the value of standards to the automation community,” said Dr. Maurice J. Wilkins, executive advisor at Yokogawa Marketing HQ, ISA Fellow, former vice president of ISA’s Standards and Practices Department, current co-chair of the ISA101 Human-Machine Interfaces Standard Committee, and member of the ISA Executive Board’s Industry Reach & Awareness work group. “We are grateful to the many automation engineering professionals who took the time to tell us how standards are helping them, their employees, and their organizations.”ISA has been recognized as the expert source for automation and control systems industry consensus standards since 1949. ISA’s more than 150 standards reflect the comprehensive knowledge and hard work of more than 4,000 automation industry experts worldwide. These individuals, along with more than 140 committees, sub-committees, work groups, and task forces, collaborate on the development and maintenance of ISA standards. ISA standards cover areas as diverse as the safety of electrical equipment used in hazardous locations to cost-savings measures for interfaces between industrial process control computers and subsystems.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (isa.org) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "title": "ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance Sets Priorities for 2021",
      "content": "January 27, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA), made up of 40 member companies, has established its priorities for the year ahead. The International Society of Automation created the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance to advance cybersecurity readiness and awareness in manufacturing and critical infrastructure facilities and processes. The ISAGCA brings end-user companies, automation and control systems providers, IT infrastructure providers, services providers, and system integrators and other cybersecurity stakeholder organizations together to proactively address growing threats.The group’s 2021 priorities include:Advocating the inclusion of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of cybersecurity standards in global policies that intend to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurityPublishing a fully detailed, auditable cross-referencing guide that maps the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards to other cybersecurity standards across multiple industriesIssuing comparison analysis reports that identify the implications of selecting and applying the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and help minimize the effort it takes to comply with cybersecurity standards and policiesCreating an insurance underwriters’ work group that will determine how to leverage ISA/IEC 62443 in creating and adjusting cybersecurity-related insurance policiesPublishing a two-part report that analyzes the use of ISA/IEC 62443 to secure IIoT reference architectures: Phase 1 (Securing IIoT devices and gateways) and Phase 2 (Securing cloud-based system-level functionality)Formalizing recommended best practices to improve cyber incident response plans, in collaboration with the ICS4ICS public-private partnership tasked with creating an incident command system for industrial control systemsMaking available a slate of new educational training, including an operations technology-focused course on basic cybersecurity hygiene for technicians and operators and microlearning modules about cybersecurity principles and the basics of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards“The technologies that control and automate the world’s most critical operations, including the facilities where we work and live, are under constant threat and attack,” said ISAGCA Advisory Board Chair Megan Samford, Vice President and Chief Product Security Officer for Schneider Electric’s Energy Management business. “Given how important the ISA/IEC 62443 standard has become to limiting, mitigating, and even eliminating these threats, the projects and programs we have launched within the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance this year will deliver clarity, alignment, and education and further our collective ability to improve control and automation systems cybersecurity.”The ANSI/ISA 62443 series of automation and control systems cybersecurity standards, which were developed primarily by ISA, have been adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 62443 and endorsed by the United Nations. The standards define requirements and procedures for implementing electronically secure automation and industrial control systems and security practices and assessing electronic security performance. The standards approach the cybersecurity challenge holistically, bridging the gap between operations and information technology.“Consistent, global adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards will help vendors, third parties, end users—indeed the entire digital supply chain—effectively and proactively manage risks to their people, assets, and operations,” said ISAGCA Advisory Board Vice Chair Sharul Rashid, Custodian Engineer and Group Technical Authority of Instrumentation and Control at PETRONAS. “The march of digital technology and open process automation initiatives means global industry continues to advance at great pace. But in our haste to reap the benefits of digitalization, we must not lose sight of cybersecurity as a key piece of the productivity puzzle. Our priorities this year will help keep global focus on securing critical assets from harm.”Recently, the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance released two helpful, free guides for public use:Quick Start Guide: An Overview of the ISA/IEC 62443 Standards (www.isa.org/cyberguide): A user-friendly overview answering often-asked questions about ISA/IEC 62443 series of standardsSecurity Lifecycles in the ISA/IEC 62443 Series (www.isa.org/securitylifecycles): A whitepaper that provides a high-level view of the product security lifecycle and the automation solution security lifecycle, and defines IACS principal roles and responsibilitiesISAGCA is made up of 40 member companies, representing more than $240 billion in aggregate revenue across more than 2,400 combined worldwide locations. Automation and cybersecurity provider members serve 31 different industries, underscoring the broad applicability of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards.Current members of ISAGCA include 1898 & Co.

      "content": "February 18, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaIberian Lube Base Oil Company, S. A. (ILBOC), has won the 2019 ISA100 Wireless Excellence in Automation award. In so doing they join a list of distinguished end users which include BAPCO, Alcoa, Phillips 66, PETRONAS, NIPPON STEELE & SUMIKIN ENGINEERING.Andre Ristaino, the ISA100 Wireless Managing Director, presented Mr. Gomez with ILBOC's award at the ARC World Forum. Vicente Blazquez, CEO of Bitherm, also participated in support of their customer, ILBOC.Each year the ISA100 Wireless Compliance Institute honors one end-user who has demonstrated exceptional leadership, creativity, and engineering excellence in the field of deploying ISA100 Wireless technology.In winning, ILBOC was chosen from several potential candidates. Their use case was a 904 node ISA100 Wireless steam trap monitoring application. A steam trap monitoring application of this large size is a great example of the power of ISA100 Wireless technology. The installation also included a unique ESCO (Energy Services company) contract with Bitherm that had NO upfront costs. All payments to Bitherm from ILBOC are based upon energy savings.Luis Sancho Gomez of ILBOC presented their experiences at the 2020 ARC World Forum in Orlando, Florida.View ILBOC's presentationhere.ILBOC is a joint venture (JV) between SK LUBRICANTS (South Korea, world leader in the lube base oil market) and REPSOL PETROLEO (first refining company in Spain). This JV was signed in 2012, same year of its plant construction started and only two years later, in 2014, ILBOC began its production becoming the biggest production plant of new generation lube base oils in Europe (Groups III & II), with a capacity of 630,000 tons per year.Global monitoring of facilities and processes is a requirement in their Safety, Quality & Environmental (SQE) policies. Large-scale equipment monitoring (e.g. steam traps and valves) can be expensive and difficult to implement. The adoption and implementation of ISA100 Wireless has reduced costs related to installation of sensors and simplified the process of monitoring 904 elements (possibly the world's largest current ISA100 installation) by combining in a single management platform several applications:Fight against Climate Change.Monitoring steam leaks and energy efficiency in steam traps.Safety.Monitoring hazardous gas leaks in safety valves.Employee Health and Safety.Detection of toxic gas (H2S) detection in the environment.Prevention of Catastrophic RisksDetection of explosive gas (hydrocarbons) in the environment.Safety & Reliability.Monitoring tightening torque on flange bolts & nuts (this is a specific experimental application for ILBOC needs to prevent dangerous Hydrogen leaks by gaskets between flanges, in R&D phase).Other remarkable features of this project are the following:Solar powered.All ISA100 wireless transmitters and sensors have been powered by rechargeable batteries with small solar panels. This allows the battery life to be extended extraordinarily.All-in-one architecture.The wireless network has been deployed by the powerful all-in-one CDS VR950 Gateway, which contains all the necessary components for network management and comes with advanced features such as redundancy and network collocation. This has strengthened the ISA100 wireless network, simplifying installation and commissioning while reducing costs.System redundancy.A VR950 ISA100 Gateway pair assures full system redundancy. In case of a hardware/software failure, the system recovers seamlessly and completely.Sandbox environment.Due to enhanced hardware capability, one can add applications on top of the VR950 for local processing and storage.Channel blacklisting.Avoids congested channels due to interference and enhances coexistence with other networks such as Wi-Fi.Field device auto-discovery.Enables the automatic reading of field device characteristics so that sensor/actuator data can be sent/received without additional manual configurations.Intensive Maintenance.This project has allowed the implementation of Intensive Maintenance, a methodology based on Smart Leak Detection and Repair (SLDAR), which has brought enormous benefits to ILBOC.ILBOC's Learned lessons: \"This large-scale deployment of wireless sensors demonstrated how ISA100 Wireless improved safety, environment, reliability, operations, maintenance, and reduced costs.\"ILBOC's leadership in the development and implementation of large-scale wireless applications for Oil & Gas is groundbreaking. WCI believes ILBOC's work will serve as inspiration to drive the industry forward.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (www.isa.org) is a nonprofit professional association that sets the standard for those who apply engineering and technology to improve the management, safety, and cybersecurity of modern automation and control systems used across industry and critical infrastructure.

The installation also included a unique ESCO (Energy Services company) contract with Bitherm that had NO upfront costs. All payments to Bitherm from ILBOC are based upon energy savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"https://www.isa.org/getmedia/be74dbf8-46fc-4499-9e03-059a3678e3f1/2-1.jpg?width=500&height=375&ext=.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\r\n\r\n            <figcaption>Luis Sancho Gomez of ILBOC presented their experiences at the 2020 ARC World Forum in Orlando, Florida.</figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View ILBOC's presentation <a href=\"https://isa100wci.org/en-US/Documents/Presentations/Excellence-and-Leadership-in-ISA100-Wireless-Appli.aspx\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILBOC is a joint venture (JV) between SK LUBRICANTS (South Korea, world leader in the lube base oil market) and REPSOL PETROLEO (first refining company in Spain). This JV was signed in 2012, same year of its plant construction started and only two years later, in 2014, ILBOC began its production becoming the biggest production plant of new generation lube base oils in Europe (Groups III & II), with a capacity of 630,000 tons per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global monitoring of facilities and processes is a requirement in their Safety, Quality & Environmental (SQE) policies. Large-scale equipment monitoring (e.g. steam traps and valves) can be expensive and difficult to implement. The adoption and implementation of ISA100 Wireless has reduced costs related to installation of sensors and simplified the process of monitoring 904 elements (possibly the world's largest current ISA100 installation) by combining in a single management platform several applications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Fight against Climate Change.</strong> Monitoring steam leaks and energy efficiency in steam traps.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Safety.</strong> Monitoring hazardous gas leaks in safety valves.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Employee Health and Safety.</strong> Detection of toxic gas (H2S) detection in the environment.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Prevention of Catastrophic Risks</strong> Detection of explosive gas (hydrocarbons) in the environment.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Safety & Reliability.</strong> Monitoring tightening torque on flange bolts & nuts (this is a specific experimental application for ILBOC needs to prevent dangerous Hydrogen leaks by gaskets between flanges, in R&D phase).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Other remarkable features of this project are the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Solar powered.</strong> All ISA100 wireless transmitters and sensors have been powered by rechargeable batteries with small solar panels. This allows the battery life to be extended extraordinarily.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>All-in-one architecture.</strong> The wireless network has been deployed by the powerful all-in-one CDS VR950 Gateway, which contains all the necessary components for network management and comes with advanced features such as redundancy and network collocation. This has strengthened the ISA100 wireless network, simplifying installation and commissioning while reducing costs.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>System redundancy.</strong> A VR950 ISA100 Gateway pair assures full system redundancy. In case of a hardware/software failure, the system recovers seamlessly and completely.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sandbox environment.</strong> Due to enhanced hardware capability, one can add applications on top of the VR950 for local processing and storage.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Channel blacklisting.</strong> Avoids congested channels due to interference and enhances coexistence with other networks such as Wi-Fi.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Field device auto-discovery.</strong> Enables the automatic reading of field device characteristics so that sensor/actuator data can be sent/received without additional manual configurations.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Intensive Maintenance.</strong> This project has allowed the implementation of Intensive Maintenance, a methodology based on Smart Leak Detection and Repair (SLDAR), which has brought enormous benefits to ILBOC.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ILBOC's Learned lessons: \"This large-scale deployment of wireless sensors demonstrated how ISA100 Wireless improved safety, environment, reliability, operations, maintenance, and reduced costs.\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILBOC's leadership in the development and implementation of large-scale wireless applications for Oil & Gas is groundbreaking. WCI believes ILBOC's work will serve as inspiration to drive the industry forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About ISA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Society of Automation (<a href=\"/\">www.isa.org</a>) is a nonprofit professional association that sets the standard for those who apply engineering and technology to improve the management, safety, and cybersecurity of modern automation and control systems used across industry and critical infrastructure.

Rothenberg, Ph.D.,-a globally recognized expert in alarm management and operator support technology-the book explores control room management as a discipline, focusing on the applicable tools, technology, and methodologies that foster safer, more effective control room functioning and improved industrial production.Situation management is the sum total of the real-time decisions and actions that the operator makes that determine whether or not the enterprise operates safely and productively. These include accurately and appropriately assessing the current operating environment, transforming that assessment into needed action for proper management of abnormal situations, and validating the effectiveness of the action.\"Properly understood and executed, it is a game changer in safe and effective operation of industrial plants and operations,\" states Rothenberg. \"It advances a firm technical framework that ties together all of the traditional individual aspects (e.g., procedures, the human machine interface, control room design, and more) into a technology to understand and design effective control room management operations.

      "content": "April 20, 2023Durham, N.C.For the second year in a row, theInternational Society of Automation(ISA) will celebrate the vast field of automation with a digital celebration through the entire month of April.Founded on 28 April 1945, ISA is the leading professional society for automation and industrial cybersecurity, offering an expansive networking community for automation professionals to engage in international conferences, trainings, events, and member-exclusive benefits. Each year, ISA and its global community celebrate 28 April asInternational Automation Professionals Day.Because this is a digital celebration, automation professionals around the world can participate in International Automation Professionals Day not just on 28 April, but all month long. Career-established individuals, entry-level personnel, and automation students are encouraged to engage with ISA on social media with images and testimonials that feature them on the job, studying for their automation-related major, or by giving statements about why they enjoy their line of work, and why they believe automation is changing the world.ISA Executive Director Claire Fallon said that the automation field is vital to many sectors, and the day celebrates the hard work of professionals who are working to keep society safe and secure.“I want all automation professionals to know that they make the world a better place,” she said. “Because of them, the world is safer, more efficient, and more effective. Professionals are the people, not the machines, that creatively look at a problem and tenaciously tackle it from every angle until the best solution is found.”The broad spectrum of the automation field means that many may not be familiar with the importance of these careers, something that former ISA President Carlos Mandolesi spoke about last year.“It is very common that our friends, relatives, and the population in general do not understand what we do when we say that we work in automation,” he said. “It is important to have a date to celebrate and promote the automation profession.”This year, ISA hopes to engage an even larger audience, and encourages members and non-members to participate in the festivities.ISA President Marty Bince said that those in automation play a vital factor in life’s modern-day conveniences, and he is happy to highlight their achievements.“This will be a time to celebrate all the outstanding opportunities that automation professionals have and the contributions they make,” he said. “From power production to smart manufacturing, instrumentation, and digitalization, automation professionals play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, safety, efficiency and competitiveness of our businesses for all the things that make life wonderful.”Automation Professionals Day takes place on 28 April and you can participate in the celebration by using #IAPD or #AutomationProDay on social media anytime during the month of April.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "July 20, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA), with contributing author Pierre Kobes, have released a white paper entitled, “Applying ISO/IEC 27001/2 and the ISA/IEC 62443 Series for Operational Technology Environments.”Many organizations have established policies and procedures governing the IT security in their office environment predominantly based on ISO/IEC 27001/2. Some organizations have attempted to secure their operational technology (OT) infrastructure under the ISO/IEC 27001/2 management system and have leveraged IT commonalities in their OT environments. However, the ISA/IEC 62443 series are purpose-built for securing OT systems and when used in combination with ISO/IEC 27001/2, it ensures that organizations maintain conformance with ISO/IEC 27001/2 through common approaches wherever feasible, while applying different approaches for IT vs. OT where needed.The white paper offers guidance for organizations familiar with ISO/IEC 27001 who are interested in protecting the OT infrastructure of their operating facilities by applying the ISA/IEC 62443 series. It describes the relationship between the ISA/IEC 62443 series and ISO/IEC 27001/2 and how both standards may be effectively used in a complementary approach within one organization to protect both IT and OT.“I often hear the debate about whether to use ISO/IEC 27001/2 or ISA/IEC 62443 for securing OT infrastructure,” commented Andre Ristaino, Managing Director of ISAGCA. “The right answer is both, and this whitepaper describes how these two globally-accepted standards can be used together for establishing an integrated, company-wide cybersecurity plan.”The white paper is available to downloadhere.About ISAGCAThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is made up of 50 member companies, representing more than $300 billion in aggregate revenue across more than 2,400 combined worldwide locations.

      "title": "ISA Provides Cybersecurity Training to U.S. National Guard Soldiers and Airmen During Cyber Shield 2020",
      "content": "September 27, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) was honored to support the U.S. National Guard’s defensively focused tactical cybersecurity exercise, Cyber Shield 2020. From 12 September to 27 September, more than 600 National Guard Soldiers and Airmen from more than 40 states signed into networks across the U.S. for virtual training designed to sharpen their skills as network defenders.ISA was proud to provide Cyber Shield 2020 with comprehensive industrial and automation control systems (IACS) cybersecurity training programs, including IACS Cybersecurity Design & Implementation (IC34) and IACS Cybersecurity Operations & Maintenance (IC37). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISA pivoted quickly to offer these courses to National Guard Soldiers and Airmen in a virtual setting, delivering online instruction and labs based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards.Two ISA Technical instructors for Cyber Shield 2020 give an overview of the next lab. This photo shows industrial control systems (ICS) along the back wall and center table with laptops that provided multiple Virtual Machines VM to complete the Industrial Automation Control System (IACS). During training week, the students virtually accessed the laptops and used these VMs to view the Operator Station’s user interface screens for application status, reviewed engineering logs to discover anomalies, and analyzed network traffic to evaluate the robustness of the environment. Students then hardened the IACS to reduce cyberattack surfaces. Photo credit International Society of Automation.“This year has presented a number of challenges for Cyber Shield,” said George Battistelli, Cyber Shield 2020 exercise director and chief of the information technology, security, compliance and readiness division for the Army National Guard. “Obviously the big change to the exercise this year is the virtual environment. COVID-19 forced us to go virtual this year. We have had to change some plans, but for the most part, we maintained the same challenging and rewarding exercise that has kept participants coming back each year.”“Training week is probably one of the highlights of Cyber Shield,” said Col. Teri Williams, officer in charge of Cyber Shield 2020. “We bring in some of the top vendors across the country to provide the training to the individuals. A lot of times the states don’t have the ability to contract some of the real high-end vendors. So this exercise gives us the ability to get Soldiers and Airmen the training that they otherwise would not get in their individual states.”Cyber Shield is hosted annually by the Army National Guard, with assistance from the Air National Guard. The exercise was conceived in cooperation with industry network owners and law enforcement agency partners to ensure it meets the demands of defending the nation’s at-risk information infrastructures. As a result of this annual exercise, National Guard cyberdefenders are better prepared to stand as another line of defense in the critical warfighting domain of cybersecurity.This was the fifth year that ISA has participated in Cyber Shield. “ISA training during Cyber Shield helps National Guard Soldiers and Airmen protect our nation’s critical infrastructure. They will be also able to better communicate with automation professionals they encounter when performing their duties,” says Mark Weisner, technical manager for ISA on Cyber Shield 2020.ISA subject-matter expert on industrial cybersecurity and instructor for Cyber Shield 2020, Wally Magda, speaking at the event. Photo credit International Society of Automation.For ISA’s training this year, ISA subject-matter expert on industrial cybersecurity, Wally Magda, presented a series concepts supported with labs. Each student had their own real-time virtual access to a complete industrial automation control system from Enterprise network level to the process control level.“In these uncertain times, cyberattacks are more prevalent than ever. When it comes to protecting critical infrastructure, ISA believes it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the differences between IT and IACS cybersecurity, also known as operational technology (OT) cybersecurity,” says Mary Ramsey, executive director of ISA. “In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ISA was able to pivot efficiently to deliver virtual instruction and labs based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of industrial cybersecurity standards. ISA is proud to provide industrial cybersecurity training to U.S. National Guard Soldiers and Airmen during Cyber Shield for the fifth year running.”About ISAThe International Society of Automation (isa.org) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISA pivoted quickly to offer these courses to National Guard Soldiers and Airmen in a virtual setting, delivering online instruction and labs based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n <img alt=\"IMG_7119-ISa-CS2020-Virtual-remote-access-lab-with-ICS-Systems.jpg\" src=\"/getattachment/f50b44e8-3894-45a4-ada8-3eaddd50366d/IMG_7119-ISa-CS2020-Virtual-remote-access-lab-with-ICS-Systems.jpg?width=500&height=475\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 475px;\" title=\"IMG_7119-ISa-CS2020-Virtual-remote-access-lab-with-ICS-Systems.jpg\"/><br/>\r\n<em>Two ISA Technical instructors for Cyber Shield 2020 give an overview of the next lab. This photo shows industrial control systems (ICS) along the back wall and center table with laptops that provided multiple Virtual Machines VM to complete the Industrial Automation Control System (IACS). During training week, the students virtually accessed the laptops and used these VMs to view the Operator Station’s user interface screens for application status, reviewed engineering logs to discover anomalies, and analyzed network traffic to evaluate the robustness of the environment. Students then hardened the IACS to reduce cyberattack surfaces.

COVID-19 forced us to go virtual this year. We have had to change some plans, but for the most part, we maintained the same challenging and rewarding exercise that has kept participants coming back each year.”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“Training week is probably one of the highlights of Cyber Shield,” said Col. Teri Williams, officer in charge of Cyber Shield 2020. “We bring in some of the top vendors across the country to provide the training to the individuals. A lot of times the states don’t have the ability to contract some of the real high-end vendors. So this exercise gives us the ability to get Soldiers and Airmen the training that they otherwise would not get in their individual states.”<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nCyber Shield is hosted annually by the Army National Guard, with assistance from the Air National Guard. The exercise was conceived in cooperation with industry network owners and law enforcement agency partners to ensure it meets the demands of defending the nation’s at-risk information infrastructures. As a result of this annual exercise, National Guard cyberdefenders are better prepared to stand as another line of defense in the critical warfighting domain of cybersecurity.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nThis was the fifth year that ISA has participated in Cyber Shield. “ISA training during Cyber Shield helps National Guard Soldiers and Airmen protect our nation’s critical infrastructure. They will be also able to better communicate with automation professionals they encounter when performing their duties,” says Mark Weisner, technical manager for ISA on Cyber Shield 2020.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<img alt=\"IMG_7138-ISA-CS2020-Instructor-1.jpg\" src=\"/getattachment/0fe81b8a-5111-4b48-a712-813673b9ca50/IMG_7138-ISA-CS2020-Instructor-1.jpg?lang=en-US\" title=\"IMG_7138-ISA-CS2020-Instructor-1.jpg\"/><br/>\r\n<em>ISA subject-matter expert on industrial cybersecurity and instructor for Cyber Shield 2020, Wally Magda, speaking at the event.

Each student had their own real-time virtual access to a complete industrial automation control system from Enterprise network level to the process control level.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“In these uncertain times, cyberattacks are more prevalent than ever. When it comes to protecting critical infrastructure, ISA believes it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the differences between IT and IACS cybersecurity, also known as operational technology (OT) cybersecurity,” says Mary Ramsey, executive director of ISA. “In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ISA was able to pivot efficiently to deliver virtual instruction and labs based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of industrial cybersecurity standards. ISA is proud to provide industrial cybersecurity training to U.S. National Guard Soldiers and Airmen during Cyber Shield for the fifth year running.”\r\n</p><h3>About ISA</h3>\r\nThe International Society of Automation (<a href=\"https://www.isa.org\">isa.org</a>) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "February 13, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe Medical Device Innovation, Safety, and Security Consortium (MDISS), a major nonprofit public health and patient safety organization, has announced it is developing a set of recommended practices and profiles for securing medical systems based on the normative requirements in the widely used ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards for industrial automation and control systems cybersecurity.The intent is to share the information across the network of MDISS member organizations, which includes medical device manufacturers, healthcare software companies, hospital networks, and insurance companies. \"MDISS is committed to improving the state of cybersecurity in medical devices and systems to reduce risks to patients. We view the ISA/IEC 62443 standards as providing a solid basis for the development of comprehensive profiles and recommended practices in this area,\" states Dr. Dale Nordenberg, MDISS Executive Director.The ISA/IEC 62443 standards are developed primarily by the ISA99 committee of the International Society of Automation, with simultaneous review and adoption by the Geneva-based International Electrotechnical Commission.ISA99 draws on the input of cybersecurity experts from across the globe in developing standards in a balanced, consensus process that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute. The standards are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure, providing a flexible and comprehensive framework to address and mitigate current and future security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems.Application to connected medical devices reflects the growing use of the standards across multiple sectors worldwide, points out long-time ISA99 co-chair Eric Cosman. \"When we first formed the ISA99 committee, we deliberately stated our scope in terms of potential consequences rather than limiting ourselves to specific industries. This decision has served us well as the ISA/IEC 62443 standards not only have been applied across traditional manufacturing and industrial processing sectors, but also extended to rail transportation, building automation, and now medical systems.\"The MDISS announcement follows another recent indication of the widespread adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 standards in which the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe confirmed it will integrate the standards into its forthcoming Common Regulatory Framework on Cybersecurity (CRF). The CRF will serve as an official UN policy position statement for the massive EU trade markets.For information on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and related training and learning resources, contact Charley Robinson, ISA Standards,crobinson@isa.orgor 1-919-990-9213.FacebookTwitterLinked In",

The ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards are designed to provide a flexible set of requirements to address and mitigate current and future security threats in automation and control systems products, system implementations, and ongoing operations.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nAWS’s membership provides leadership for establishing ISA/IEC 62443 standards and ISASecure as the basis for securing operational technology in automotive, CPG, energy, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, power & utilities, transportation, smart buildings and smart cities around the globe.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n“We welcome the AWS team and look forward to working with them here at ISCI. Cloud service providers like AWS are enabling Industrial IoT solutions today that are transforming how manufacturers, producers, and others use industrial automation with cloud services to monitor and optimize operations. AWS’s support of ISA/IEC 62443 and its active participation in the community as an ISCI member shows its commitment to open standards-based OT and IIoT cybersecurity. Participating in the ISASecure program is a demonstration of AWS’s desire to ensure safe and secure operations for customers at critical infrastructure sites around the globe,” said Andre Ristaino, ISCI Managing Director.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>The IEC 62443 Certification Program Most Requested by End-Users</strong><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nISASecure is an industry-led initiative established to independently certify the cybersecurity of control systems, automation, and IIoT technology. The program strives to include a balance of stakeholders and ensures that end-users fill leadership roles in ISASecure decision-making; including leading in certification specification development processes.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe ISASecure scheme has been well-vetted by end-users, certification bodies, and control system suppliers from many industry sectors including, but not limited to, traditional process industries, power generation, and building control industries.<br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nISASecure has been active for over 10 years with the first certificate of conformance issued in early 2011. The certification scheme is based upon international ISA/IEC 62443 standards developed by subject matter experts from many industries around the globe and codifying hundreds of years of OT cybersecurity subject matter expertise.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>About the ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI)</strong><br/>\r\nFounded in 2007, the ISA Security Compliance Institute’s mission is to provide the highest level of assurance possible for the cybersecurity of industrial automation control systems (IACS). ISCI is a wholly-owned conformity assessment organization within the International Society of Automation (ISA) where the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are developed.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Institute was established by thought leaders from major organizations in the industrial automation controls community seeking to improve the cybersecurity posture of Critical Infrastructure for generations to come. The Institute’s goals are realized through industry standards compliance programs, education, technical support, and improvements in suppliers’ development processes and users’ life cycle management practices. The ISASecure® designation ensures that IACS products conform to industry consensus cybersecurity standards such as ISA/IEC 62443, providing confidence to users of ISASecure products and systems and creating product differentiation for suppliers conforming to the ISASecure specification.

      "content": "August 01, 2023Durham, N.C.The International Society of Automation (ISA) today announces the publication ofControlling the Future: Controlling Non-Industrial Processes to Prevent Climate and Other Disastersby Béla Lipták, a comprehensive analysis of how processes developed and perfected by the automation industry can be used to tackle the climate change problem.To control a process, we must fully understand it. InControlling the Future, Lipták analyzes global warming as a heat balance process that has been disrupted by burning fossil fuels. Now, even knowing the dangers that global warming presents, 8 to 10 billion tons of carbon are still being emitted yearly. As more and more tipping points in the disruption of this equilibrium are reached, global warming and the frequency of its catastrophic effects will only accelerate.By understanding global warming as a process, Lipták applies process control principles to this complex problem. Lipták analyzes the dynamics and characteristics of global warming, identifies the subprocesses that sustain and escalate it, and shows what can be done.Controlling the Futuredescribes the consequences of out-of-control warming, but it also presents solutions powered by artificial intelligence and a timeframe for converting today’s energy economy into a safe and inexhaustible one by 2050.Béla Lipták has more than 50 years of professional experience, including automating several dozen industrial plants, and has published more than 300 technical articles and 20 books on automation, safety, and energy technology. He is an ISA fellow and has received both the ISA Technical Achievement Award and the ISA Lifetime Achievement Award.“I think this is a monumental work that hopefully opens people's minds as to how what we have learned and accomplished in process control can be used to solve worldwide problems for a much better future. The severity of the problems is accelerating, and the need for aggressive process control is eminent because we are approaching a tipping point where the ability to return to a safer world is threatened,” stated Greg McMillan, award winning automation professional and ISA Fellow.To purchase a copy ofControlling the Future, Controlling Non-Industrial Process: Preventing Climate and Other Disastersby Béla Lipták,click here.For more details, read the informative author interviewTo learn more about Béla Lipták’s research into the processes behind global warming and how we can solve this complex problem, read theQ&A feature with the author.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (www.isa.org) is a nonprofit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "title": "NATO Energy Security Center for Excellence and ISA Establish Cooperative Agreement on Cybersecurity Standards",
      "content": "March 10, 2021Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe ISA99 standards committee—lead developer of the widely used ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards on industrial automation and control systems security—and the NATO Energy Security Center for Excellence have signed a letter of intent for cooperation in the exchange of information and collaboration pertaining to the application of cybersecurity standards and guidelines in the energy sector.The NATO Energy Security Center for Excellence (NATO ENSEC COE) became interested in applying the ISA/IEC 62443 standards during the course of a 2018-2019 cyber risk study of the industrial control systems used in the NATO Central Europe pipeline system, according to Vytautas Butrimas, who spearheaded the agreement and now represents NATO ENSEC COE on ISA99. “With this agreement,” Butrimas stated, “we look forward to exploring new ways of collaboration with ISA to improve the safety, reliability, and performance of the backbone technologies that support economic activity, national security, and well-being of our societies.”The ISA/IEC 62443 standards are developed primarily by the ISA99 committee with simultaneous review and adoption by the Geneva-based International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ISA99 draws on the input of cybersecurity experts across the globe in developing consensus standards that are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure, providing a flexible and comprehensive framework to address and mitigate current and future security vulnerabilities in industrial automation and control systems.The agreement with NATO ENSEC COE is the latest in a string of notable milestones in the ongoing development and growing global application of the ISA/IEC 62443 series. It follows a previous decision by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to integrate the standards into its Common Regulatory Framework on Cybersecurity, which serves as an official UN policy position statement for Europe.The ISA/IEC 62443 standards are available athttp://www.isa.org/findstandards. In addition, ISA offers extensive training resources on cybersecurity as well as safety, fundamentals, and other topics in industrial automation and control systems.

      "content": "February 22, 2022Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe Linking the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cybersecurity (LOGIIC) program have announced the release of a new study report entitled, “SBOM Study: Managing ICS Software Risks to Oil & Gas.”In 2021, LOGIIC conducted a study to understand how a software bill of materials (SBOMs) and other vendor capabilities can be used to manage cybersecurity risks to industrial control systems (ICS) software that may be introduced from third-party components that are part of vendor solutions. This study was based on SBOM research conducted by LOGIIC. Reference material for the study included Executive Order 14028 (May 12,2021) that President Biden issued on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity. The order includes new requirements for software vendors selling software to the U.S. government. One of these requirements consists of providing a U.S. government purchaser a SBOM for each product either directly or by other means such as a website.A SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software. It is effectively a list of ingredients or a nested inventory. SBOMs enable better software security and supply chain risk management. It is critical for each industry sector to establish a common set of practices and market expectations that is viable and reflects the needs of the industry.The study included discussions with Oil and Gas industrial control system vendors to understand and analyze the current state of SBOM development and utilization. The study also makes industry recommendations for SBOM development.To read the report, please visit theLOGIIC homepage.About LOGIICThe Linking the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cybersecurity program (LOGIIC) is an ongoing collaboration of oil and natural gas companies and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate.

      "content": "February 19, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) today announces the third edition release of Start-Up: A Technician’s Guide, a best-practice handbook to help control system technicians meet the high-pressure demands and fast-emerging challenges of getting new plants and new plant systems up and running.The release has been updated to reflect the latest industry technologies, terminology, and references, and highlight the essential processes, phases, and documents required to effectively plan for, implement, and manage a successful plant start-up.The book serves as a practical guide for those seeking to become anISA Certified Control Systems Technician® (CCST®), an objective, consensus-based validation of technician competency in all essential job-task domains of automation and control. These domains include all essential job functions, such as calibration, maintenance, repair, troubleshooting, loop-check, and all project duties—from start-up and planning to documentation and management.The author—Diane R. Barkin—brings more than three decades of expertise and experience in automation project engineering and management; design, specification, order, programming, and training; and assistance with construction and start-up. She serves as President and Senior Project Consultant of Harris Automation Services, Inc. in Houston, Texas.“Plant start-ups can be very frustrating and the book is intended to help alleviate that frustration,” Barkin points out. “These situations are often fast-paced, stressful, and noisy—with sometimes difficult personalities and personal attitudes to grapple with. Control system technicians must be willing and able to learn in these settings and be organized and patient—all while being cognizant of vital safety procedures and efficiency objectives.”Barkin emphasizes that while the book is particularly valuable to technicians preparing for ISA CCST certification, it will be useful to any control system technician seeking to gain state-of-the-art knowledge and improve their on-the-job skills and capabilities.To purchase a copy of the third edition of Start-Up: A Technician’s Guide,click here.For more details, read the informative author interviewFor greater perspective on the value and significance of the updated edition and its areas of new and enhanced content, read theQ&A featurewith the author.Obtain your copy ofStart-Up: A Technician’s Guidetoday.To get your copy of this informative reference manual,order it todayon the ISA website.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (www.isa.org) is a nonprofit professional association that sets the standard for those who apply engineering and technology to improve the management, safety, and cybersecurity of modern automation and control systems used across industry and critical infrastructure.

We look forward to returning to the UK in the future to ensure that we continue to share knowledge and advocate for standards-based OT cybersecurity practices.” <br/>\r\n <br/>\r\nThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association of engineers, technicians, and management engaged in industrial automation.  As the globally trusted provider of foundational standards-based technical resource for the profession, ISA strives to build a better world through automation.  To find out more, visit <a href=\"http://www.isa.org/\">www.isa.org</a><br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nIssued by Granite PR on behalf of the International Society of Automation (ISA). <br/>\r\nFor further information, contact Morgan Foor, <a href=\"mailto:mfoor@isa.org\">mfoor@isa.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>    <figure>\r\n        <img src=\"https://www.isa.org/getmedia/8117bd6c-af25-4703-adb4-60a84a740cb1/ISA-OT-Cybersecurity-Summit-2023_VIPs.jpg?width=1000&height=679&ext=.jpg\" alt=\"Pictured, from left:  Steve Mustard (ISA Treasurer and ISA OT Cybersecurity Summit conference committee chair); Cheri Caddy (Deputy Assistant National Cyber Director, The White House); Megan Samford (Vice President and Chief Product Security Officer for energy management at Schneider Electric) and Dr David Cameron, Lord Provost of Aberdeen. \"/>\r\n\r\n    </figure>\r\n​Pictured, from left: Steve Mustard (ISA Treasurer and ISA OT Cybersecurity Summit conference committee chair); Cheri Caddy (Deputy Assistant National Cyber Director, The White House); Megan Samford (Vice President and Chief Product Security Officer for energy management at Schneider Electric) and Dr David Cameron, Lord Provost of Aberdeen.</p>\r\n\r\n                                <ul class=\"socialBar\">\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-facebook\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/InternationalSocietyOfAutomation\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Facebook</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-twitter\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ISA_Interchange\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Twitter</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li class=\"socialBar-item\">\r\n                    <a class=\"socialBar-link socialBar-link ico-linkedin\" target=\"blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=137598\"><span class=\"socialBar-text\">Linked In</span></a>\r\n                </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\r\n                    </article>\r\n                    ",

      "title": "UL panel upholds ISA appeal - ISA",
      "content": "April 24, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaAn appeals panel formed by Underwriters Laboratories has ruled in favor of the International Society of Automation (ISA) in an appeal against UL 2900-2-2, Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable Devices, Part 2-2: Particular Requirements for Industrial Control Systems. UL was seeking approval of the document as an American National Standard, but ISA's successful appeal prevents that status at this time.ISA's appeal was driven by an underlying goal in standards development-to avoid burdening users with overlapping and duplicating standards. ISA was specifically concerned about overlap with the widely used ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards on industrial automation and control systems security. The ISA/IEC standards are developed by the ISA99 standards committee as American National Standards with simultaneous review and adoption by the Geneva-based International Electrotechnical Commission through IEC partner committee TC65. With more than 900 members, ISA99 draws on the input of cybersecurity experts across the globe in developing the standards, which are applicable to all industry sectors and critical infrastructure.ISA's successful appeal asserted that UL failed to follow a key clause in its procedures as accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), intended to prevent duplication and overlap. ISA's concern was shared by many, including leaders within IEC TC65 and by NEMA, the largest trade association of electrical equipment manufacturers in the US. A NEMA letter to UL in December 2017 had formally requested that \"UL withdraw UL 2900-2-2 and … focus on the adoption of the relevant parts of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards.\"Prior to the appeal, UL acknowledged that it had missed earlier opportunities to identify potential overlap and duplication,\" pointed out Charley Robinson, Director of ISA Standards. \"However, UL declined an offer from ISA to drop the appeal if UL would agree to work with ISA99 to conduct a detailed gap analysis and comparison in order to revise UL 2900-2-2 to remove overlaps and make it truly complementary to the ISA/IEC 62443 series.\" Had UL accepted the invitation, he added, it could have avoided a finding that the Appeals Panel failed \"to find strong evidence of a good faith effort made by UL to collaborate and resolve duplication as required by ANSI once potential duplication was identified.\"\"ISA continues to be willing to work with UL to make the UL document complementary to the ISA/IEC 62443 series,\" stated long-time ISA99 co-chair Eric Cosman, an industrial cybersecurity consultant and retired Dow Chemical Engineering Fellow. \"To that end, we invited UL once again to work with us as soon as the appeal decision was announced.\"Without approval as an American National Standard, the UL document is unlikely to achieve international standard status through the IEC. IEC TC65 leaders had previously made clear that the UL document would have little chance of achieving that status in any event, as in their view it would violate a long-standing IEC principle of \"one standard, one test -- accepted everywhere.\" That principle is vitally important to both end-user and supplier companies that sell and operate in multiple countries.In contrast, the ISA/IEC 62443 standards are recognized and applied by companies and organizations across the globe. The standards are cited throughout the US NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and are being integrated into the Common Regulatory Framework on Cybersecurity of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which will establish a common legislative basis for cybersecurity practices within the massive EU trade markets.For information on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards and related training and learning resources, contact Charley Robinson, ISA Standards,crobinson@isa.orgor 1-919-990-9213.FacebookTwitterLinked In",

      "title": "New Guide to Cybersecurity Standards: ISA Introduces an Overview of the ISA/IEC 62443 Series",
      "content": "March 18, 2020Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance have released a new guide to the world’s only consensus-based automation cybersecurity standards.“Quick Start Guide: An Overview of the ISA/IEC 62443 Series of Standards,” now available for download atisa.org/cyberguide, provides a high-level view of the objectives and benefits of these standards—as well as easy-to-use explainers on how to navigate them. The guide explores how and why IT and OT/ICS need unique types of protection against cyber threats and offers the latest recommendations on patch management.This new guide answers some of the most common questions about the ISA/IEC 62443 Standards, including:Why is this series of standards important? What are the benefits of using the standards?How are IT and ICS systems different?Which documents are part of the series and how can I use them to find what I need?Where can I find the current best practices around patch management?The ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance’s Advocacy and Adoption work group coordinated the development of the guide, which was authored by Johan Nye. Nye is an independent consultant specializing in industrial control systems and cybersecurity. During his career spanning more than 38 years, Nye has designed ICS system architectures, created company standards and policies, implemented major ICS projects, supported ICS site engineers, and contributed to the design of several ICS products.“Automation cybersecurity standards are crucial in this increasingly connected world,” says Mary Ramsey, ISA executive director. “The ISA/IEC 62443 Series of Standards leads the way as the world’s only consensus-based standards that focus on automation cybersecurity. One goal of the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is to raise awareness of these standards and encourage their adoption across a wide range of industries.

What are the benefits of using the standards?</li>\r\n\t<li>How are IT and ICS systems different?</li>\r\n\t<li>Which documents are part of the series and how can I use them to find what I need?</li>\r\n\t<li>Where can I find the current best practices around patch management?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance’s Advocacy and Adoption work group coordinated the development of the guide, which was authored by Johan Nye. Nye is an independent consultant specializing in industrial control systems and cybersecurity. During his career spanning more than 38 years, Nye has designed ICS system architectures, created company standards and policies, implemented major ICS projects, supported ICS site engineers, and contributed to the design of several ICS products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Automation cybersecurity standards are crucial in this increasingly connected world,” says Mary Ramsey, ISA executive director. “The ISA/IEC 62443 Series of Standards leads the way as the world’s only consensus-based standards that focus on automation cybersecurity.

      "title": "New White Paper: Implementing an Industrial Cybersecurity Program for Your Enterprise",
      "content": "January 11, 2022Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA), with contributing author Gary Rathwell, have released a new white paper entitled, “Implementing an Industrial Cybersecurity Program for Your Enterprise.”ISA/IEC 62443 provides powerful tools to reduce the risk of financial, reputational, human, and environmental impact from cyber-attacks on Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). ISA/IEC 62443 has been categorized as a “horizontal standard” by the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC), validating its applicability for a wide range of industries. Any specific company is likely to find that while most of the standard applies to their IACS, parts of it may not. For example, some “normative requirements” that are appropriate for an interstate pipeline, may not be relevant to a chemical plant or a discrete manufacturing facility. There are also obvious differences between a large-scale corporation with many sites and thousands of employees, and a small company with a few dozen staff.It is therefore recommended that each company establishes their own IACS Cybersecurity Program to manage cybersecurity risks, and ISA/IEC 62443 2-1 provides guidance on how to establish such a security program for IACS asset owners.The white paper is intended to summarize the guidance from the series of standards and address the specific needs of owner/operators of industrial facilities. The paper covers the following topics:What is an IACS cybersecurity program?Preparing an IACS cybersecurity programHow does an IACS cybersecurity program relate to IT cybersecurity?Costs and benefits of an IACS cybersecurity programWhat to do next“Creating an IACS cybersecurity program is approachable, and companies should be working with their vendors and partners to build such a program if they don’t already have one in place,” said contributing author Gary Rathwell. “This paper gives a foundation for building a program, and there is no time to waste for companies and organizations looking for protection from, and mitigation of, cyber incidents.”The white paper is available to downloadhere.In the coming months, ISAGCA plans to publish additional white papers intended to guide IACS vendors, suppliers of IACS products and services, integration/engineering services, and other stakeholders as they prepare IACS cybersecurity programs within their facilities and operations.About ISAGCAThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) is a collaborative forum of member companies that aim to advance cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, and knowledge sharing industry-wide, on a global scale. The alliance’s objectives include expanding the development and use of the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards, knowledge-sharing in an open environment, providing best practice tools to help companies secure their infrastructure, creating education and certification programs, and advocating for cybersecurity awareness and sensible approaches with world governments and regulatory bodies.About ISAGCA MembersThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance is made up of 50+ member companies, representing more than $1.5 trillion in aggregate revenue across more than 2,400 combined worldwide locations.

The paper covers the following topics:\r\n</p><ol>\r\n\t<li>What is an IACS cybersecurity program?</li>\r\n\t<li>Preparing an IACS cybersecurity program</li>\r\n\t<li>How does an IACS cybersecurity program relate to IT cybersecurity?</li>\r\n\t<li>Costs and benefits of an IACS cybersecurity program</li>\r\n\t<li>What to do next</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n“Creating an IACS cybersecurity program is approachable, and companies should be working with their vendors and partners to build such a program if they don’t already have one in place,” said contributing author Gary Rathwell. “This paper gives a foundation for building a program, and there is no time to waste for companies and organizations looking for protection from, and mitigation of, cyber incidents.”<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe white paper is available to download <a href=\"https://gca.isa.org/implementing-an-industrial-cybersecurity-program-for-your-enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the coming months, ISAGCA plans to publish additional white papers intended to guide IACS vendors, suppliers of IACS products and services, integration/engineering services, and other stakeholders as they prepare IACS cybersecurity programs within their facilities and operations.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>About ISAGCA</strong><br/>\r\nThe ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance (ISAGCA) is a collaborative forum of member companies that aim to advance cybersecurity awareness, education, readiness, and knowledge sharing industry-wide, on a global scale.

      "content": "March 19, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaThis week at the SANS ICS Security Summit ISA's Director of Strategic Initiatives, Marty Edwards was honored by his peers in the ICS security community with the SANS ICS Lifetime Achievement Award.This award recognizes individuals who have contributed exceptional efforts to enhance the security of industrial control systems on an international scale, and who actively strive to bridge the gap between information technology and operations technology. Through educational contributions to the community, honorees have significantly increased the awareness of risks to industrial control systems and fostered the idea that cyber secure ICS implementations and defense in ICS are achievable.\"Marty's unwavering commitment to his mission to help industries mature and better defend ICS from evolving cybersecurity threats continues to have an unmistakably positive effect on society,\" said Mike Assante, director of critical infrastructure and lead for the ICS Curriculum at SANS Institute. \"His active involvement in the community has made industrial cybersecurity a mainstream topic worthy of attention at the highest-levels of government and with public and private companies alike.\"As Director of Strategic Initiatives at the International Society of Automation (ISA), Edwards works with government and industry leaders throughout the world to broaden understanding and implementation of the ISA/IEC 62443 cybersecurity standards. These internationally recognized standards are key components of The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (updated April 2018), a how-to guide developed through the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help strengthen the cyber defenses of critical infrastructure.Prior to joining ISA in mid-2017, Edwards-a 25-year industry veteran-was the longest-serving Director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT.) Under his leadership, the ICS-CERT was awarded the 2013 SC Magazine Security Team of the Year Award and was named as a finalist in the Community Awareness category in the 2015 Government Information Security Leadership Awards (GISLA.)Edwards also served as a program manager focused on control systems security at the Idaho National Laboratory and has held a variety of roles in the instrumentation and automation fields. Edwards holds a diploma of technology in Process Control and Industrial Automation (Magna cum Laude) from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), and in 2015 received the institute's Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2016, Edwards was recognized by FCW in its \"Federal 100 Awards\" as being one of the top IT professionals in the U.S. federal government.Edwards also currently serves as the Managing Director of the Automation Federation, an association of non-profit member organizations dedicated to fostering economic growth and manufacturing innovation by helping industry harness the immense capabilities and potential of automation technologies and applications. The Automation Federation was founded by the ISA in 2006.More about ISA99/IEC 62443Developed by leading international cybersecurity experts from industry, government and academia, ISA/IEC 62443 is a flexible framework for preventing and limiting cyber damage to industrial control systems and networks.Because most industrial automation and control systems are not designed to ensure resilience against cyber warfare, a cyberattack can impair and disable safe operations of industrial facilities. The consequences—which can include plant shutdowns, widespread power blackouts, explosions, chemical leaks, and more—can place national and economic security as well as lives, personal safety and the environment at risk.ISA/IEC 62443 enables owners and operators of critical infrastructure to achieve and maintain security improvements through a lifecycle that integrates design, implementation, monitoring and continuous improvement.For more informationTo learn more about IEC 62443, ISA's Security Lifecycle Training Program, and ISA's wide range of industrial cybersecurity resources, contact Heidi Cooke, Sr. Learning Consultant, at +1 -919-990-9405 or via email athcooke@isa.org.FacebookTwitterLinked In",

      "content": "August 17, 2023Durham, N.C.ISA100 Wireless now supports Bluetooth Low Energy and OPC-UAToday the ISA100 Wireless Compliance Institute (WCI), home of the international wireless networking standard, ANSI/ISA-100.11a-2011 (IEC 62734),Wireless systems for industrial automation: Process control and related applications, announced two major enhancements to the ISA100 Wireless™ family of standards.Bluetooth Low EnergyThe next generation of ISA100 Wireless field devices will support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a second radio. The established ISA-100 (IEC 62734) protocol will continue to be used for field reporting, as it has been since 2010. As a complementary technology, BLE will enable provisioning and commissioning of ISA100 Wireless field devices by Bluetooth-enabled handhelds, particularly by mobile phones. These new capabilities ensure ISA100 Wireless technology delivers an improved user experience when new devices are configured and deployed.OPC-UA and PA-DIMISA100 Wireless gateways are also adopting a new Open Process Communication-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) data model, based on the industry standard Process Automation Device Information Model (PA-DIM®) specification. This program will enable end-users to build a single set of applications that work end-to-end with all ISA100 Wireless systems using the OPC-UA model. Together, these ISA100 Wireless enhancements will improve interoperability and the overall user experience in the ISA100 Wireless community.PA-DIM activities started in 2017 as a Joint Working Group of the OPC Foundation (OPC) and the FieldComm Group, Inc. (FCG). In 2022 the ownership of PA-DIM was extended to WCI, NAMUR, ODVA, PNO, VDMA, and ZVEI.“We have a technical roadmap for ensuring that the ISA100 Wireless family of products evolve with proven technologies as they mature to market readiness,” stated Andre Ristaino, managing director global consortia, conformity assessment for International Society of Automation (ISA), “These new capabilities simplify setup and operation of ISA100 Wireless products and establish an industry standard approach for supporting applications using the devices.”WCI members will describe these new ISA100 Wireless capabilities during a webinar scheduled for 30 August 2023. The webinar will provide an overview of these updates, followed by an opportunity for participants to ask questions.

ISASecure recently released an IIOT component and gateway certification program (ICSA) to remain current with new technology advances. However, asset owners and plant managers have yet to coalesce around a single cybersecurity assessment scheme for OT deployed at operating sites, relying instead upon a patchwork of third-party specifications that may not promote industrial control system (ICS) security best practices, leaving operating sites vulnerable.“The proposed site assessment scheme will have a critical role in the OT cybersecurity landscape—the automation systems at the operating site itself,” said Brandon Price, ExxonMobil Senior Principal Engineer for ICS Cybersecurity and current ISCI Board Chairman. “This standards-based program is unique, and we anticipate it will become the global specification used by operating sites, certification bodies, internal auditors, and public policy makers.”The program will encourage the broad industry adoption of the ISA/IEC 62443 operating site cybersecurity standards and best practices. ISA and ISCI plans include building and overseeing a related training and credentialing program for site assessors. ISA and other training organizations already offer training for the ISA/IEC 62443 operating site standards.“We are inviting companies who are interested in supporting and promoting this program to participate; particularly end-users whose support is critical to this program’s success. Supporters may participate in specification development, provide funding, or simply provide public support,” said Andre Ristaino, Managing Director of ISA Consortia and Conformity Assessment Programs.“We anticipate a development schedule of 12–14 months and expect to formally launch the program in Q4 2024 or early 2025,” said Ristaino.To learn more and to get involved, visithttps://isasecure.org/isasecure-site-assessment-0.An informational webinar will also be held on 28 February at 11 am Eastern — to register, visithttps://register.gotowebinar.com/register/8957191695766506073.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

      "content": "March 06, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaConference program leverages historical events focused on power generation, municipal water to encourage collaboration between industry sectorsTheISA Energy & Water Automation Conference, slated for 7-8 August 2019 at the Omni Championsgate Resort in Orlando, Florida, will feature interactive sessions led by ISA's power generation, alternative energy, municipal water, and industrial water experts.The conference program will feature technologies and best practices that apply to multiple infrastructure sectors. Today's challenges include leveraging data analytics in a meaningful way, navigating the new world of IIoT with safety and cybersecurity in mind, and applying the insights of recent Smart Cities Initiatives to improve operations. These challenges-and many promising best practices-are relevant for several industry sectors, and this unique event will bring people together to move everyone forward.\"Part of ISA's mission is to increase technical competency by connecting automation professionals, and this event is a perfect example of how that can benefit our industries,\" said ISA Executive Director Mary Ramsey. \"Technology applications that are working in one sector can often translate to another, but users and solution providers have to engage in meaningful dialogue to find those synergies. ISA can be a venue for those discussions in multiple ways, from standards development to content creation to in-person events.\"ISA's Water Wastewater Industries Division will bring expertise and content focused on effective utility management, water/wastewater operations and maintenance, IT/OT coordination, engineering best practices, integration/programming, SCADA, PLCs, instrumentation, cybersecurity, and asset management related to the treatment and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of wastewater.ISA's Power Industries Division plans to host sessions covering automation and control solutions for oil and gas exploration, processing, and refining with a focus on power generation methodologies, including harnessing wind and solar energy.Many industries rely on sourcing, transporting, handling, recycling, and disposing industrial water as a core element of their power generation strategies.

      "content": "May 01, 2019Research Triangle Park, North CarolinaExtensive initiative designed to defend critical infrastructure against cyberattackThe International Society of Automation (ISA) in April provided operational technology (OT) training in support of the US Army National Guard's national cyber-operations exercise, Cyber Shield.Cyber Shield 19-held 5-18 April 2019 at Camp Atterbury, Indiana-brought together approximately 800 Army and Air National Guard network defenders and world-class cybersecurity professionals, industry network owners, an Army Reserve assessment team, and federal and state agencies to train the next generation of cyber warriors in the ever-changing, dynamic world of information systems and networks.\"The training that Soldiers and Airmen obtained through Cyber Shield 19 and the National Guard adds to their ability to conduct their civilian jobs and, vice versa, the training and experience they receive in their civilian positions strengthen the military's cyber capabilities. They become very valuable assets in protecting critical infrastructure,\" said George Battistelli, the Army National Guard Cybersecurity Program Manager, Information Technology Strategy Division Chief and the Cyber Shield 19 Exercise Director.Cyber Shield includes a critical training component that offers industry-leading courses and seminars that are organized into tracks based on the roles of the participating cyber team members.\"We focus on getting people prepared for cyber defense,\" said Col. Teri Williams, Commander, Cyber Shield 19. \"There are a lot of people we bring to the table for that first week of training. Microsoft, CISCO and SANS are on hand for some of the cyber defensive training. The International Society of Automation (ISA) provides ICS/SCADA network training. We also focus on the offensive side. Our belief is that the better that you are trained on the offensive side the stronger a defender you will be. \"ISA was selected by the National Guard because of its leadership and experience in developing the world's only consensus-based series of industrial cybersecurity standards, ISA/IEC 62443. These standards, which also serve as the basis for ISA cybersecurity training, protect the industrial automation and control systems (IACS) and networks that operate OT machinery and associated devices within critical infrastructure. Without these defenses in place, industrial cyberattack can result in plant shutdown, operational and equipment impairment, severe economic and environmental damage, and public endangerment.Given their protective capabilities, the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards are key components of theUS Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  (dated April 2018), a how-to guide developed through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help strengthen America's cyber defenses.During the first week of Cyber Shield 2019, ISA's subject-matter experts taught three ISA courses:  ISA Cybersecurity courses included: Introduction to Industrial Automation Security and the ISA/IEC 62443 Standards (IC32C); IACS Cybersecurity Design & Implementation (IC34), and IACS Cybersecurity Operations & Maintenance (IC37) courses.Click hereto view photos of ISA personnel providing IACS security training during the training component of the exercise.To access additional images, visit theCyber Shield 2019 photo pageon the Defense Visual Distribution Service website.More about ISA99/IEC 62443Developed by leading international cybersecurity experts from industry, government and academia, ISA/IEC 62443 is a flexible framework for preventing and limiting cyber damage to IACS and networks.Because most IACS are not designed to ensure resilience against cyber warfare, an IACS cyberattack can impair and disable safe operations of industrial facilities. The consequences-which can include plant shutdowns, widespread power blackouts, explosions, chemical leaks, and more-can place national and economic security as well as lives, personal safety and the environment at risk.ISA/IEC 62443 enables owners and operators of critical infrastructure to achieve and maintain IACS security improvements through a lifecycle that integrates design, implementation, monitoring and continuous improvement.For more informationTo learn more about IEC 62443, ISA's IACS Security Lifecycle Training Program, and ISA's wide range of industrial cybersecurity resources, clickhereor contact Heidi Cooke, Sr. Workforce Development Consultant, at +1 -919-990-9405 or via email at hcooke@isa.org.FacebookTwitterLinked In",

As the paper describes, automation also has a significant role to play in achieving sustainability goals – offering new ways to accelerate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities across manufacturing, industry, and beyond.Specific recommendations are offered for organizations seeking to demonstrate ESG leadership through the application of automation technologies and systems, including:Optimizing energy usage by using automation to manage lighting, heating, and cooling systemsRelying upon advanced sensors and other automation technologies to reduce the risk of injury to personnel by isolating hazardous processesProviding accountability and transparency by surfacing data and offering objective analysisCreating new jobs and upskilling opportunities as needs and technologies evolve – the World Economic Forumestimatesan additional 12 million new jobs created by 2023 due to automation“ISA has led the automation profession for 78 years, and we are pleased to continue our thought leadership by offering recommendations on how sustainability and automation can drive business excellence,” said Prabhu Soundarrajan, ISA President-Elect Secretary. “We see a symbiotic relationship between sustainability and automation. Industry and manufacturing organizations have much to gain by embracing sustainable automation practices, and businesses that have not already relied on automation technologies and standards to a significant degree will find that doing so helps them achieve their sustainability goals.”The position paper isavailable now on the ISA website. Future position papers to be published by the Society will address such topics as operational technology cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructure, and the role of automation in workforce development and job creation.About ISAThe International Society of Automation (ISA) is a non-profit professional association founded in 1945 to create a better world through automation.

The students were selected for their strong academic performance and financial needs. The scholarships were funded by theBeamex Annual Calibration Exchange.Crystal Sandoval, 3.95 GPA, Cal Poly Civil Engineering Major\"As a low-income, female Latina pursuing a STEM career, I faced an array of challenges in my life. Ironically, one of my biggest obstacles was in academics. I started the year with zero dollars in my bank account and a low GPA, but with a different mindset, I worked full time to help out with the family's household expenses while attending college full time. I share my story and tell college students that failure should not be taken lightly - a person only fails when they give up. Thank you for taking the time into organizing this scholarship and awarding it to me. I feel extremely honored and happy to be part of the engineering community and I hope to continue being an exemplary student, person, and future engineer.\"Sepehr Ramshini, 3.92 GPA, Construction Engineering Management\"My parents always encouraged me to go to college because no one else in our family has gone before. The main reason that we immigrated to the U.S. was because of my desire to go to the best universities. They have always done their best for me to ensure I am going to be successful in my life and career. They made sacrifices and chose to leave their family, friends, and comfortable life behind. I understand that they only made these sacrifices for me so I can be the first person in my family to attend college. I would like to have my own firm, after gaining enough experience and finishing my education. I want to achieve happiness and help others to achieve it with me.\"About BeamexBEAMEX is a leading worldwide provider of calibration solutions that meet even the most demanding of requirements for process instrumentation.
